{"text": "I-765, Application for Employment Authorization Alert Type info Alert: On Nov. 20, 2025, USCIS announced a Federal Register notice that will increase certain immigration-related H.R. 1 fees for fiscal year 2026. These fee adjustments reflect the amount of inflation from July 2024 through July 2025. The new inflation-adjusted H.R. 1 fees are effective Jan. 1, 2026. If you submit a benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, that requires one of these H.R. 1 fees, you must include the new fee for the specific benefit you are requesting. We will reject any affected immigration benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, without the proper filing fee. See the web alert for more information. Alert Type info ALERT: Please remember that photos submitted to USCIS must be unmounted and unretouched. Unretouched means the photos must not be edited or digitally enhanced. The submission of any mounted or retouched images will delay the processing of your application and may prompt USCIS to require that you appear at an Applicant Support Center to verify your identity. If you have not already started the EAD application process, you can begin here by creating a USCIS account online and filing Form-I-765 . We will mail your work permit to the address you provided in your application if your application is approved. If necessary, you can file a paper application for Form I-765 instead. Certain aliens who are in the United States may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, to request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Other aliens whose immigration status authorizes them to work in the United States without restrictions may also use Form I-765 to apply for an EAD that shows such authorization. After we approve a Form I-765, your EAD card should be produced within 2 weeks. We will mail your EAD card via U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Priority Mail. Please ensure you have the correct mailing address on file with USCIS. If your mailing address changes after you file your application, you must update your address with USCIS and USPS as soon as possible. If you don’t update your address promptly, your case could be delayed, your document(s) could get lost, and you may need to reapply and pay the fee again. The timeframe in which you will receive your EAD card may vary, depending on USPS delivery times. Please allow a total of 30 days from approval before inquiring with USCIS. We encourage you to use Case Status Online to find your USPS tracking number for EAD card delivery. If you have not received your EAD card within this time frame, please visit e-Request - Self Service Tools for instructions on how to submit an inquiry.

Where to File For a complete list of mailing addresses, visit our Form I-539 Direct Filing Addresses page. When to File Nonimmigrant visas are issued to foreign nationals who intend to remain in the United States for a temporary (less than permanent) period. The period varies for different nonimmigrant categories. We understand that plans can change. If your original reason for coming to the United States changes, you may be eligible to extend your status or you may be required to change your nonimmigrant status to a different one before you lawfully begin to engage in the activities you want to pursue. You may apply to extend or change your status in the United States if you: Were lawfully admitted into the United States as a nonimmigrant; Have not committed any act that would make you ineligible to receive an immigration benefit; There is no other factor that requires you to depart the United States prior to making a reentry based on a different classification (for example, a USCIS officer may determine that you should obtain a new visa prior to being readmitted into the United States); and Submit your Form I-539 application for an extension or change of status by mail or you can file online before the expiration date as shown on the admission stamp in your travel document on your Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record. (There are certain very limited circumstances under which USCIS will excuse a late submission.) Please note that some nonimmigrant visa categories are not eligible to extend or change status (C, D, K-1, K-2, S, TWOV, WT, and WB) and some can only change or extend status subject to certain restrictions (J-1 and M-1). For further guidance, please refer to the filing instructions for Form I-539. If you are eligible to file an I-539 application, you must apply for extension of stay or change of status before your current authorized stay expires.

Even if you are approved for another status in the future, you will be required to file a Form I-539 to “bridge” any gap that might arise between the expiration of your current status and validity of your future status. Therefore, we suggest you file at least 45 days before your stay expires or as soon as you determine your need to change or extend status. Failure to file before the expiration date may be excused if you demonstrate when you file the application that: The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control; The length of the delay was reasonable; You have not otherwise violated your status; You are still a bona fide nonimmigrant; and You are not in removal proceedings. Your passport must be valid for your entire requested period of stay in the new nonimmigrant classification in the United States. If your status expired before you filed Form I-539 with USCIS to change or extend your status, or if you have otherwise violated the terms of your status (such as by working without authorization), then you are “out of status.” If you fall out of status, we cannot change your status except in certain limited circumstances beyond your control. Staying longer than the period for which you were granted admission may also negatively affect your ability to obtain other benefits or to return to the United States later. If you fall out of status, we recommend that you leave the United States to limit the possible impact on your ability to come back to the United States in the future. Filing Fee You can find the filing fee for Form I-539 by visiting our Fee Schedule page. You can pay the fee by credit card or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions , or by ACH transaction using Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions . We will also accept a money order, personal check, or cashier’s check. If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. When you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. If you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our Fee Calculator to help determine your fee. If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.

{"text": "I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records Alert Type info Alert: On Nov. 20, 2025, USCIS announced a Federal Register notice that will increase certain immigration-related H.R. 1 fees for fiscal year 2026. These fee adjustments reflect the amount of inflation from July 2024 through July 2025. The new inflation-adjusted H.R. 1 fees are effective Jan. 1, 2026. If you submit a benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, that requires one of these H.R. 1 fees, you must include the new fee for the specific benefit you are requesting. We will reject any affected immigration benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, without the proper filing fee. See the web alert for more information. Alert Type info ALERT: New Immigration Parole Fee We are implementing a new immigration parole fee required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill. The fee is $1,000 for FY 2025 and is subject to annual adjustments for inflation. Do not pay the immigration parole fee when you submit Form I-131 to USCIS. Beginning on Oct. 16, 2025, if you are in the United States and we determine that we can approve your request for parole or re-parole and that it requires payment of the immigration parole fee, we will notify you that you must pay this fee before we can approve your request. The notice we send you will contain payment instructions and a deadline. We will not grant parole unless you pay the immigration parole fee as instructed and within the specified time period. See our web alert for more information. Alert Type info ALERT: Re-Parole Process for Certain Ukrainian Citizens and Their Immediate Family Members On Feb. 27, 2024, we announced a process for eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to apply for re-parole so they can continue to temporarily remain in the United States. We encourage eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to submit their re-parole requests to us no earlier than 180 days (6 months) before the expiration of their current period of parole . You can find your parole expiration date on your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record , issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when you were paroled into the United States. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of parole and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your re-parole request. If you submit a request for re-parole more than 180 days before the expiration of your current period of parole, we may reject or deny your re-parole application without refunding the filing fees . Please note that filing earlier than 180 days before your current parole expiration date will not result in a faster decision. Use this form to apply for travel documents, parole documents, or arrival/departure records. Travel Documents You may use this form to apply for a reentry permit, refugee travel document, TPS travel authorization document, advance parole document, or advance permission to travel for Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) long-term residents. If we approve your Form I-131 and you are a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiary in the United States who wishes to travel outside the United States, we will issue you Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by an Alien to the United States. If we approve your Form I-131 and your initial application for TPS (Form I-821) is still pending, we will issue you a Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document. If you are a TPS beneficiary or have a pending initial TPS application, you should carefully read the Form I-131 Instructions. These instructions explain certain risks you may face if you are outside the United States while we are considering your TPS re-registration or initial application, such as missing important requests for evidence or other notices or being denied TPS while you are outside the United States. For information on travel documents, including potential immigration-related consequences of traveling outside the United States, see our Travel Documents page. If you are in the United States and you have an urgent need to travel outside the United States, see our Expedite Requests page and Emergency Travel page. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will determine at its discretion during inspection whether you may be admitted into TPS. You may be admitted into TPS if you travel and return in accordance with your TPS travel authorization, your TPS remains valid, and you are not inadmissible for certain criminal or security grounds that are mandatory ineligibility grounds for TPS. Note that if you were previously granted parole, this admission will render you ineligible for a new period of parole (re-parole).

If you file this form to request advance permission to travel for CNMI long-term residents, and you leave the CNMI without having an advance permission to travel document, your status will automatically terminate. Initial Parole Documents You may use this form to apply for parole into the United States for yourself or someone else who is an alien and who is currently outside the United States based on urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. A parole request from outside the United States may fall under an existing program or process, such as the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program, parole under the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, or the Family Reunification Task Force (FRTF) process. Your initial parole document may be a boarding foil that is placed in your passport, or it may be a Form I-512L travel document. Arrival/Departure Records for Parole in Place If you are an alien who is currently inside the United States and you are present without having been admitted, you may use this form to apply for parole in place based on urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, including requests for military parole in place and the FRTF process. Arrival/Departure Records for Re-Parole If you are an alien who is inside the United States, who was previously granted parole, and who needs an additional period of parole, then you may use this form to apply for re-parole based on urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit. If we authorize your re-parole, you will be issued a Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Record with a new Admit Until Date or Parole Until Date. Generally, the DHS component that initially authorized parole has jurisdiction over any request for re-parole, unless DHS or USCIS provides alternate filing instructions. Please see the Memorandum of Agreement between USCIS, ICE, and CBP for more information about each agency’s jurisdiction over re-parole requests. Form I-131 includes filing instructions for specific types of re-parole requests processed by USCIS. Your re-parole request may fall under an existing program or process, such as for those who were initially paroled under the family reunification parole processes, certain Afghans paroled into the United States after July 31, 2021, certain Ukrainians paroled into the United States after Feb. 11, 2022, the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program, Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, Central American Minors Program, FRTF Process, or military parole in place.

You must have a student visa to travel to the United States to study. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine whether you need an F visa or an M visa. To enter the United States to attend: You need the following visa category: University or college High School Private elementary school Seminary Conservatory Another academic institution, including a language training program Vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program Students cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with Visitor Visas You must have a student visa (F or M visa) to travel to the United States to study. You may not study after entering on a visitor (B) visa, unless you are eligible for and have obtained a change of status from USCIS, or through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake recreational (non-credit) study as part of a tourist visit. For more information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa may be appropriate A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas Study leading to a U.S. conferred degree or certificate is not permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration. For example, a student in a distance learning program that requires a period of time on the institution’s U.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to entering the United States. Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School The first step to studying in the United States is apply to a SEVP-approved school in the United States. If the SEVP-approved school accepts your enrollment, you will be registered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee. The SEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20. After you receive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa. You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when you attend your visa interview. If your spouse and/or children will live with you in the United States while you study, they must also enroll in SEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved school, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS fee). Visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) website to learn more about SEVIS and the SEVIS I-901 Fee. Visit the Department of State EducationUSA website to learn about educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate study, and an overview of the application process.

While we recommend you use a professional visa photo service to ensure your photo meets all the requirements, you may take the photo yourself. Photos must not be digitally enhanced or altered to change your appearance in any way. Please review the following technical requirements and references for guidance on taking your own photo. Photo Composition Template Digital Image Requirements Use the Department of State’s free photo tool to: select a digital image stored on your computer resize and rotate it if necessary crop it to a square image of exactly 600 x 600 pixels, and save it to your computer for printing Please note: This tool is intended for photo cropping only. A Department of State employee will make the final decision whether your visa photo is acceptable or not for your application. Taking photos of your baby or toddler When taking a photo of your baby or toddler, no other person should be in the photo, and your child should be looking at the camera with his or her eyes open. Tip 1: Lay your baby on his or her back on a plain white or off-white sheet. This will ensure your baby's head is supported and provide a plain background for the photo. Make certain there are no shadows on your baby's face, especially if you take a picture from above with the baby lying down. Tip 2: Cover a car seat with a plain white or off-white sheet and take a picture of your child in the car seat. This will also ensure your baby’s head is supported Change of Appearance If your photo(s) or digital image does not reflect your current appearance, even if it is not older than 6 months, the U.S. embassy or consulate will request that you provide a new photo with your application. Applicants will be requested to obtain a new photo if they have: Undergone significant facial surgery or trauma Added or removed numerous/large facial piercings or tattoos Undergone a significant amount of weight loss or gain Generally, if you can still be identified from the photo in your visa application, you will not need to submit a new photo. For example, growing a beard or coloring your hair would not generally be considered a significant change of appearance. If the appearance of your child under the age of 16 has changed due to the normal aging process, he or she will generally not have to provide a new photo. However, the acceptance of your photo or digital image is at the discretion of the U.S. embassy or consulate where you apply. Español Already have a photo? Use our Photo Tool to crop your photo so it's the right size. This photo tool does not check the quality of your image. This tool is for cropping your photo only when you are applying or renewing using a paper form. Do not use this tool if you are renewing online. After you apply, a U.S. Department of State employee will review your photo and decide if we can accept your photo.

If you plan to apply for a nonimmigrant visa to come to the United States as a temporary visitor, please review the current wait time for an interview using the Global Visa Wait Times table linked below. Global Visa Wait Times Wait Time for Interview The estimated wait time to receive a nonimmigrant visa interview appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate and is based on workload and staffing and can vary from week to week. The information provided is an estimate and does not guarantee the availability of an appointment. Wait Time for Interview Waiver Wait times for applicants eligible for Interview Waiver are applicable only for locations where applicants schedule appointments to submit their passport and any required documents to a U.S. embassy or consulate. The wait time estimate does not account for the time required for a consular officer to adjudicate the application nor mailing time of passports or other documents. Refer to the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will apply to determine your eligibility for Interview Waiver and for instructions for submitting a nonimmigrant visa application. Note that applicants must be a national or resident of the country where they are applying to be eligible to apply via Interview Waiver. Qualifications for an Expedited Interview Appointment Consular sections overseas may be able to expedite your interview date if there is an urgent, unforeseen situation such as a funeral, medical emergency, or school start date. The process to request an expedited nonimmigrant visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment. In all cases : You must first submit the online visa application form (DS-160), pay the application fee, and schedule the first available interview appointment. Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment. Note: Travel for the purpose of attending weddings and graduation ceremonies, assisting pregnant relatives, participating in an annual business/academic/professional conference, or enjoying last-minute tourism does not qualify for expedited appointments. For such travel, please schedule a regular visa appointment well in advance. Administrative Processing These estimates do not include time required for administrative processing, which may affect some applications. When administrative processing is required, the timing will vary based on individual circumstances of each case. Administrative Processing Information There are only two possible outcomes for U.S. visa applications. The consular officer will either issue or refuse the visa. If a visa applicant has not established that he or she is eligible for a visa, the consular officer must refuse that application. However, some refused visa applications may require further administrative processing. When administrative processing is required, the consular officer will inform the applicant at the end of the interview. The duration of the administrative processing will vary based on the individual circumstances of each case. At the conclusion of the administrative processing period, the consular officer might conclude that an applicant is now qualified for the visa for which he or she applied. The officer may also conclude that the applicant remains ineligible for a visa. Visa applicants are reminded to apply early for their visas, well in advance of the anticipated travel date. Important Notice: Except in cases of emergency travel (i.e. serious illnesses, injuries, or deaths in your immediate family), before making inquiries about status of administrative processing, applicants should wait at least 180 days from the date of interview or submission of supplemental documents, whichever is later. About Visa Processing Wait Times – Nonimmigrant Visa Applicants Information about nonimmigrant visa wait times for interviews and visa processing time frames are shown on this website, as well as on U.S. Embassy and Consulate websites worldwide.

About Wait Times * Calendar days refers to every day of the week, including days when embassies are closed (such as weekends and holidays). * Wait times are generally the MAXIMUM amount of time you will have to wait to get an appointment. Appointments are continuously being added and you will likely be given an opportunity to move your appointment up as new appointments are opened. † Work days refers only to days when the embassy is open and does not include weekends and holidays. ‡ A, G, and NATO applications are excluded from these wait times, as they are processed separately.

{"text": "Breadcrumb Home Students Maintaining Status While studying in the United States, it is important to maintain your F or M student status. Your status relates to the purpose, or reason for why you want to come to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issues you your visa based on your intended purpose. If the Department of State issues you an F or M student visa, this means that you are coming to the United States to study. You should not take any action that detracts from that purpose. Maintaining your status means: Fulfilling the purpose for why the Department of State issued you your visa. Following the regulations associated with that purpose. F-1 and M-1 students share the same primary purpose for coming to the United States however, F-1 students enroll in more traditional academic programs, while M-1 students enroll in vocational programs. Because these two types of programs are different in nature, the types of benefits a nonimmigrant student may be eligible for and how long they may remain in the country depend on whether they are an F-1 or M-1 student. Learn more about these specific differences by reviewing the F&M Student Status: Know the Difference infographic Below are actions to take in order to properly maintain your status. Arrival When arriving to the United States, both F and M students must: Enter the United States no more than 30 days before your program of study begins. Immediately contact your designated school official (DSO) when you enter the United States. When you arrive at school, you need to contact your DSO again, no later than the program start date listed on your Form I-20, \"Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.\" Education While studying in the United States, both F and M students must: Attend all your classes, and maintain normal academic progress. If school is too difficult, speak with your DSO immediately. Maintain a full course of study each term. If you cannot study full time, contact your DSO immediately. You may be eligible for a reduced course load in limited circumstances. Speak to your DSO before dropping a class. Talk to your DSO about requesting a possible program extension if you do not think you will complete your program of study by the end date listed on your Form I-20. An extension must be requested before your program end date. Annual Vacation for F-1 Students F-1 students must complete at least one full academic year at an SEVP-certified school to be eligible for annual vacation. Additionally, students must intend to register for classes in the academic term following their annual vacation. SEVP-certified schools should have clear and consistent policies regarding annual vacation and comply with the requirements laid out in SEVP Policy Guidance for Adjudicators 1408-01: Academic Year. Please note that during an annual vacation, students can take as many, as few or no courses as they want. SEVP considers all study during an annual vacation incident to status. Work and Practical Training for F-1 Students An F student may only work when authorized by a DSO in some cases, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in others. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be able to re-enter the United States at a later date. F students are eligible for curricular practical training (CPT) at either the undergraduate or the graduate level during the program of study. CPT employment must be an integral part of an established curriculum and the position must directly relate to your major area of study. Your DSO can give you the school’s policy on this option. F students are also eligible for optional practical training during or following the program of study. OPT is a form of temporary employment that directly relates to your program of study. For more information about employment and training options available for F-students, visit the Working in the United States page and talk with your DSO. Practical Training for M-1 Students M-1 students are not eligible for employment during their program of study, but may obtain authorization for practical training employment. You may participate in practical training employment after the completion of your vocational program. If you want to participate in practical training employment in the United States, talk with your DSO about your options. Practical training employment requires your DSO’s recommendation and authorization from USCIS. If you choose to work without authorization, you will be forced to leave the United States immediately.

Talk with your DSO First If you are an F or M student studying in the United States, your DSO should be the first person you talk with if you have any questions regarding the legal requirements of your stay in the United States. Your DSO can assist in answering your questions or help you find someone who can help. F-1 students should speak with their DSO if you are planning to do any of the following: Change your major, program, or degree level. Change your education level. Transfer to a new school or take a leave of absence. Take a break from school. Travel outside the United States. Move to a new address. Request a program extension. M-1 students should speak with their DSO if they are planning to do any of the following: Take a break from school. Travel outside the United States. Move to a new address.

{"text": "Breadcrumb Home Students Working in the United States The U.S. government takes working illegally very seriously. This page will help you learn the basics of the work authorization process. There are limited work opportunities available in the United States for F-1 students. For this reason, before coming to the United States, F-1 students must prove they have the financial ability (e.g., present bank statements) to pay for tuition and living expenses while studying. If you decide that you want to work, the first step is always to talk with your designated school official (DSO) If your DSO knows you are working without permission, they must report it through SEVIS , meaning your SEVIS record will be terminated. That means that you will have to leave the United States immediately, and you may not be allowed to return. Depending on your status and program of study , you may be eligible for the following type of employment opportunities while you study in the United States: On-Campus On-campus employment is work that F-1 students whose status is Active in SEVIS may apply for. On-campus employment is specific to work that takes place on campus or at an off-campus location that is educationally affiliated with the school. Examples of on-campus employment include working at a university bookstore or cafeteria. Active F-1 students may apply for on-campus employment up to 30 days before the start of classes. In order to apply, talk to your DSO. If approved, your DSO will provide you with a letter of approval. Take this letter from your DSO and a letter of approval from your employer to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN). All students who wish to work must apply for a Social Security Number. If you participate in on-campus employment, you may not work more than 20 hours per week when school is in session. If you have additional questions, please visit the F-1 Student On-Campus page on ICE.gov Off-Campus Off-campus employment is work that that takes place outside of a school campus. Off-campus employment is only available to F-1 students who have completed at least one full academic year of their program of study, and who have an economic hardship that qualifies for the Department of Homeland Security’s emergent circumstances To apply for off-campus employment, you must explain your economic hardship situation and receive approval to work from your DSO. If your DSO determines that the situation applies, he or she will recommend you and give you an updated Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Status.” Once you have the new Form I-20, you must file a Form I-765, “Application for Employment Authorization,” with USCIS within 30 days of receiving your recommendation. If USCIS approves you to work, they will send you a Form I-766, “Employment Authorization Document,” (EAD) with the dates that you may work off-campus. Please note that you cannot begin to work while the Form I-765 is pending with USCIS. As with on-campus employment, you must also apply for a SSN . Please see the F-1 Student Off-Campus resource page on ICE.gov for additional information.

Here you can find the latest information and resources for F (academic) and M (vocational) students, as well as designated school officials (DSOs). Stay Connected Sign up to receive SEVP email updates. Email Address Sign Up Background: SEVP and SEVIS The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) collects, maintains, analyzes and provides information so only legitimate foreign students or exchange visitors gain entry to the United States. SEVP also ensures that the institutions accepting nonimmigrant students are certified and follow the federal rules and regulations that govern them. SEVP manages the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) , a web-based information system that maintains and allows monitoring of the following records: SEVP-certified schools. F-1 and M-1 nonimmigrant students and their dependents. Exchange visitor program sponsors. J-1 exchange visitors and their dependents. SEVIS enables SEVP to assure proper reporting and record keeping by schools and exchange visitor programs, thereby ensuring data currency and integrity. SEVIS also provides a mechanism for student and exchange visitor status violators to be identified so that appropriate enforcement is taken (i.e., denial of admission, denial of benefits or removal from the United States). SEVP works closely with its government partners involved in the foreign student process, including U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Department of State. Working with partner law enforcement agencies, SEVP administratively enforces federal rules and regulations governing schools certified to enroll F and M nonimmigrant students. SEVIS by the Numbers View the latest annual SEVIS By the Numbers report, which uses SEVIS data from calendar year 2024 and compares that to data from calendar year 2023. You can find previous SEVIS by the Numbers reports in Freedom of Information Act Library , under Student and Exchange Visitor Program. SEVP and SEVIS Fact Sheets View SEVP and SEVIS Fact Sheets SEVIS Help Hub The SEVIS Help Hub is a central location for designated school officials to access information regarding student records, school records and SEVIS release updates. Visit the SEVIS Help Hub to find user guides, fact sheets, job aids and FAQ documents related to SEVIS. SEVIS Data Library When an individual enrolls at a U.S. school as an F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant students, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) captures certain information about that individual in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The data included in this data set has been extracted from SEVIS and provides an overview of SEVP-certified schools and active nonimmigrant students during a specific calendar year. This data is updated annually. Study in the States Initiative On Sept. 16, 2011, DHS and ICE launched the Study in the States Initiative at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A key aspect of this initiative seeks to enhance coordination between the various federal agencies that play a role in implementing our nonimmigrant student visa and exchange visitor programs. The launch of the Study in the States website was part of this initiative. Sponsored by DHS and managed by SEVP, this website provides a wealth of information and resources to encourage the best and brightest nonimmigrant students to study and learn about expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. The Study in the States website allows ICE and its partner agencies, as well as DoS, to more effectively communicate information to nonimmigrant students, exchange visitors and their dependents. The site features dynamic and interactive content in a user-friendly manner and uses social media tools, such as Facebook and LinkedIn to provide updates to visitors around the globe. Notices SEVP-certified schools are subject to review of their certification at any time based on federal regulation. Visit the School Alerts page for a list of schools that have been withdrawn in SEVIS upon review due to a failure to comply with SEVP regulations and to find instructions for students of these schools. Eligible F-1 and M-1 nonimmigrant students can access the SEVP Portal here . To learn about the portal please visit the SEVP Portal Help section on Study in the States.

DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List and CIP Code Nomination Process The DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List enumerates the fields of study that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designates as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) for purposes of the 24-month STEM optional practical training (OPT) extension described at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C) Current STEM list Archived 2023 STEM list Archived 2022 STEM list Archived 2020 STEM list Archived 2016 STEM list What is a CIP code? Developed by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) is a numerical taxonomy used to categorize and report on fields of study offered by educational institutions. CIP codes have a range of specificity in classifying fields of study, with designations from two digits to six digits. A two-digit code encompasses everything within that field of study, while four-digit and six-digit codes break down the field into more specific subcategories. DHS uses CIP codes to identify the STEM degrees that are eligible for the 24-month STEM OPT extension. Who may nominate a CIP code? Interested parties, including members of the public, may nominate a CIP code for inclusion on or removal from the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List. How may a nomination be submitted? Nominations may be submitted by email to the SEVP Response Center at SEVP@ice.dhs.gov , with the subject line “Attention: STEM CIP Code Nomination.” Nominations should include the following information: Title and six-digit code of the CIP code being nominated. The name, email address and telephone number of the nominator; if submitted on behalf of an educational institution or other institutional entity, please indicate the appropriate contact person at the institution. If nominating a CIP code for inclusion, a description of how the field of study under this CIP code engages students in research, innovation or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science or natural sciences (including physical, biological and agricultural sciences). If nominating a CIP code for removal, a description of how the field of study under this CIP code does not engage students in research, innovation or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science or natural sciences (including physical, biological and agricultural sciences). The annual deadline for nominations is August 1. SEVP will review all nominations submitted by August 1 and publish any changes in a future update to the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List. The program will announce any changes to the list via a Federal Register Notice and through its communication channels, including Broadcast Messages, Study in the States blog posts and social media. Nominations submitted after August 1", "metadata": {"id": "e760d66a8abfa2dc", "url": "https://www.ice.gov/sevis/schools", "title": "Schools and Programs | ICE", "agency": "WWW.ICE.GOV", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "e760d66a8abfa2dc-2"}}

If nominating a CIP code for removal, a description of how the field of study under this CIP code does not engage students in research, innovation or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science or natural sciences (including physical, biological and agricultural sciences). The annual deadline for nominations is August 1. SEVP will review all nominations submitted by August 1 and publish any changes in a future update to the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List. The program will announce any changes to the list via a Federal Register Notice and through its communication channels, including Broadcast Messages, Study in the States blog posts and social media. Nominations submitted after August 1 will be assessed during the next review cycle. How does DHS assess nominations? Nominations to add or remove degrees from the STEM Designated Degree Program List are assessed consistent with the authorizing regulation at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(c)(2) . SEVP evaluates submissions to assess whether the degree is generally considered to be a STEM degree by recognized authorities, including input from educational institutions, governmental entities and non-governmental entities. SEVP also reviews the NCES definition of the CIP code and any supporting material submitted by the nominator such as the required curriculum for the degree and the extent to which it is comprised of core STEM disciplines as well as student involvement in research, innovation and development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science or natural sciences (including physical, biological and agricultural sciences). The degree requirements and curriculum may be assessed across academic institutions to ensure that the core aspects of the degree are sufficiently consistent among educational institutions. A proposed addition does not have to have all supporting elements to be added to the STEM list. DHS assesses the totality of a submission and may approve a proposed CIP code if it presents sufficient evidence and reasoning to establish that the regulatory definition of a STEM field encompasses the degree under consideration. CIP Eligibility. Under 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(2) , a STEM field of study is a field of study “included in the Department of Education’s Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) taxonomy within the 2-digit series containing engineering, biological sciences, mathematics, and physical sciences, or a related field. In general, related fields will include fields involving research, innovation, or development of new technologies using engineering, mathematics, computer science, or natural sciences (including physical, biological, and agricultural sciences).” Accordingly, DHS designates all CIP codes in the following four series to be STEM: Engineering (14) Biological and Biomedical Sciences (26) Mathematics and Statistics (27) Physical Sciences (40) All CIP codes in these four series automatically qualify for the 24-month STEM OPT extension. If a CIP code is from one of these four series, it does not need to be nominated as it is already approved. DHS has designated select qualifying degrees from the following CIP code series at the six-digit level as related fields because these specific fields of study were deemed to sufficiently engage students in the core STEM disciplines. However, CIP code nominations are not restricted to these fields: Agricultural/Animal/Plant/Veterinary Science and Related Fields (01) Natural Resources and Conservation (03) Architecture and Related Services (04) Communication, Journalism and Related Programs (09) Communications Technologies/Technicians and Support Services (10) Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services (11) Education (13) Engineering/Engineering-Related Technologies/Technicians (15) Military Science, Leadership and Operational Art (28) Military Technologies and Applied Sciences (29) Multi/Interdisciplinary Studies (30) Science Technologies/Technicians (41) Psychology (42) Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services (43) Social Sciences (45) Transportation and Materials Moving (49) Health Professions and Related Programs (51) Business, Management, Marketing and Related Support Services (52) 1.

There is a $1,250 fee for SEVP-certified schools submitting a petition for recertification. One hundred and eighty days before a school’s certification expiration date (CED), designated school officials (DSOs) will receive notice from SEVP through Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) that the school is eligible to apply for recertification. Please note: Your school will not be able to submit for recertification unless your school has received its 180-day notice via SEVIS. Schools may submit non-substantial Form I-17, “Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student,” edits while filing for recertification. Substantial edits such as a change of ownership, a change of location or the addition of a location must be submitted as an update prior to submitting for recertification. For example, a school may submit the recertification petition with a request to add a program of study to the Form I-17. In this circumstance, SEVP will adjudicate both the school’s eligibility for recertification and approval for the new program of study at the same time. However, the school would not be allowed to enroll new students into the requested program of study until adjudication is complete and an approval is granted for the new program. Principal designated school officials (PDSOs) can follow the basic steps in the Recertification Checklist (PDF) to submit for recertification. Quick Recertification Submission Tips The Form I-17 must be signed in its entirety. This includes signatures by the principal designated school official (PDSO), all DSOs, the president, owner or head of school. Successfully filing for recertification consists of submitting for recertification via SEVIS and paying the $1,250 recertification filing fee. This includes electronically submitting the petition and uploading all evidence in SEVIS. Upon receipt of your complete recertification submission in SEVIS, you will receive a Notice of Confirmation of Complete Filing from the Recertification Team. If you have not received a Notice of Confirmation of Complete Filing by your school’s CED, your school will be automatically withdrawn. The Recertification Team strongly recommends that you submit your complete recertification filing in SEVIS as soon as possible and no later than 30 days prior to the CED. Your school’s SEVP certification expires at 12:01 a.m. on the CED listed in SEVIS. If a recertification submission is received on the day prior to the CED, your school may be temporarily withdrawn from SEVIS Please submit your recertification filing via SEVIS only. All evidence must be uploaded to SEVIS. Effective March 8, 2018, SEVP no longer accepts submissions via email. SEVP does not accept submissions via fax or U.S. mail. If a school is pending recertification adjudication and a material change occurs during that time that requires an update to the Form I-17, the school should report the change(s) by email to SEVP@ice.dhs.gov Recertification information is located at the bottom of this page. Recertification Instructions Once you have been notified via SEVIS that your school is within the 180 days of the CED, your school must submit a completed recertification filing prior to the CED. Please review the Recertification Checklist (PDF) Getting Started with SEVP Recertification , and the Form I-17 – Recertification article on SEVIS Help Hub to assist you in completing the recertification process. Do not submit the checklist with your recertification package. This is strictly for your use to ensure all required documentation and procedures are included and completed. In order to file for recertification, you must electronically submit for recertification via SEVIS. Review the Form I-17 If the information on the Form I-17 does not accurately reflect your school and its current operations, you may submit non-substantial updates to the Form I-17 as part of the school’s petition for recertification.

Petition Updates Regulations require Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified institutions report any material changes to the Form I-17, “Petition for Approval of School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student.” SEVP-certified institutions are required to keep all Form I-17 sections up to date in order to ensure the Form I-17 reflects the institution’s current operating status. Principal designated school officials (PDSOs) at an institution with a Form I-17 that does not match the institution’s current operating status must update the petition in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 21 days of the change(s). Note: Once the petition update is submitted in SEVIS, the petition is then locked for edits while pending adjudication. SEVP recommends that designated school officials (DSOs) review the institution’s Form I-17 on a regular basis to ensure it reflects the school’s most up-to-date information. 8 CFR 214.3(g) and (h) requires that updates are made within 21 days of any changes. The entire Form I-17 must be kept up to date; however, the following sections when updated must be adjudicated: 1.1: Approval of Attendance of Students Under 1.2: Name of School or School System 1.3: Name of Main campus 1.7: Location of school 1.8: School type – remove (with name and address of owner 1.8 & 1.9) 1.9: Private School Owner 2.1: School is engaged in 2.2: Areas of study 2.3: Degrees available 2.4: Courses of study and time necessary to complete 3.2, 3.3 & 3.4: Accreditation and recognitions 3.6: FAA Certification School official additions Instructional site addition PDSO or DSO information While SEVP does not adjudicate the following sections, schools are still required to keep these sections of the Form I-17 up to date: 1.4: Mailing address of school 1.10: [Private School] Owner’s Address 3.1: Date school was established 4.1: School Sessions 4.2: Date Registration begins for EACH session during a calendar year 4.3: Type of Sessions (Day/Night) 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 & 4.7: Average annual numbers 4.8: Approximate Annual Cost of Room, Board, Tuition, etc., per student 4.9: Requirements for Admission 5.4: [Campus] Mailing Address With the SEVIS 6.35 Release, schools may now submit non-substantial Form I-17 edits while filing for recertification. Substantial updates such as a change of ownership or a change of location should still be submitted for adjudication prior to filing for recertification. For example, a school may submit the recertification petition with a request to add a program of study to the Form I-17. SEVP will adjudicate both the school’s eligibility for recertification and approval for the new program of study at the same time. However, the school cannot enroll new students into the requested program of study until adjudication is complete and an approval is granted for the new program. How to Submit an Update In order to update the information on the Form I-17, the primary designated school official (PDSO) must log into the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), make the appropriate edits and click Submit. The PDSO may choose the right side navigation box to go to the Submit page at any time. They may also Save Draft by using the button on the bottom of each screen. However, if they use the Cancel button, all changes will be wiped and their draft will be erased. “Draft status” means that the institution can see the updates made, but the update has not been submitted to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) for review. School officials also must upload the evidence required for adjudication at the same time they submit their updates in SEVIS. The evidence a school needs to provide to SEVP depends on what section(s) is being updated, and whether or not the school is accredited. If a school fails to upload evidence at the same time it submits the update in SEVIS, SEVP will cancel the request and ask that the school resubmit the request with the required evidence. SEVP may ask your school to provide additional evidence for adjudication through a Request for Evidence (RFE) notice that will be sent via a SEVIS-generated email. A specific due date will be included in all RFEs. Institutions should note this date and ensure", "metadata": {"id": "e760d66a8abfa2dc", "url": "https://www.ice.gov/sevis/schools", "title": "Schools and Programs | ICE", "agency": "WWW.ICE.GOV", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "e760d66a8abfa2dc-7"}}

Updating School Officials The Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVP) process for submitting new primary designated school officials (PDSOs) and designated school officials (DSOs) and changing PDSO or DSO information requires a complete submission. This includes submitting the PDSO or DSO update request and supporting evidence all at once. If documentation is missing at the time of submission, the PDSO or DSO submission will be considered incomplete and may be subject to cancellation. For more information about this process, including required evidence your school must submit, please refer to SEVP Fact Sheet: Designated School Official Submissions To make PDSO or DSO updates to your school’s locked Form I-17, a school must submit the update requests, as detailed in the SEVP Fact Sheet: Designated School Official Submissions , to SEVP by sending an email to FormI17SupportingEvidence@ice.dhs.gov How to Voluntarily Withdraw If your school would like to have its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification voluntarily withdrawn, you must submit a letter on the school’s letterhead signed by the school’s president or owner and principal designated school official. The request must be emailed to sevp@ice.dhs.gov Field Representatives Field representatives are part of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and serve as direct day-to-day liaisons between SEVP and SEVP-certified schools. The SEVP Field Representative Unit enhances national security by fostering an understanding of regulatory adherence and Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) data integrity. Additionally, SEVP field representatives: Ensure SEVP-certified schools understand SEVP rules and regulations. Answer general questions related to the nonimmigrant student process. Provide training and assistance to principal designated school officials and designated school officials. Meet with schools in their territories normally a minimum of once per year. Help school officials with the SEVP recertification process by conducting scheduled school visits. Attend conferences and meetings in their territories that pertain to nonimmigrant students. As a reminder, SEVP-certified schools are subject to on-site review at any time, per 8 CFR 214.3 (h)(3)(iv) . Please note that these reviews are not related to the SEVP field representatives and are not part of their duties. SEVP has now deployed four groups of field representatives for a total of 53. There are three regional groups – eastern, central and western – comprising 20 field representatives in each region. Each field representative will spend four days each week in the field with schools and one day in their “home office.” SEVP will continue to provide updates about the field representatives on a regular basis. Please note that there are six field representative territory vacancies in Milwaukee, WI; Norfolk, VA; Orlando, FL; Phoenix, AZ; Seattle, WA; Miami, FL; and Columbia, SC. If your school falls within any of these territories, please contact the SEVP Response Center for assistance with questions and concerns by calling (703) 603-3400 or emailing SEVP@ice.dhs.gov Information regarding hiring and deployment of these vacancies will be communicated", "metadata": {"id": "e760d66a8abfa2dc", "url": "https://www.ice.gov/sevis/schools", "title": "Schools and Programs | ICE", "agency": "WWW.ICE.GOV", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "e760d66a8abfa2dc-9"}}

To learn more about this program, please read these FAQs about the field representatives Emergencies Emergency Communications The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) understands that Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified schools may face emergency situations ranging from natural disasters to manmade catastrophes. SEVP follows a standard operating procedure for communicating with F and M students and SEVP-certified schools before, during and after emergency events. Specifically, during an emergency event: SEVP will post Broadcast Messages with important information pertaining to the emergency events on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) message board. When appropriate, the program may also send these messages via email to impacted SEVIS users. The Field Representative in the impacted areas will work to disseminate information from SEVP to the appropriate school officials. The SEVP Response Center will monitor and track requests for assistance from impacted stakeholders. The Study in the States website and social media accounts will push out important programmatic reminders and breaking news alerts to keep stakeholders informed. Emergency Tips It is important that designated school officials (DSOs) understand their role in emergency operations and keep their SEVP-certification responsibilities in mind when planning their response to campus disruptions. Specifically, we advise DSOs to: Please provide an email address and/or phone number to students and SEVP – Provide an email address and toll-free phone number, if possible, for displaced students and exchange visitors to report their location and health status to you as well as receive additional instructions from you. If you are unable to provide this information to students or exchange visitors – Advise F and M nonimmigrants to check SEVP's website and Study in the States for information and guidance and to contact SEVP via email ( SEVP@ice.dhs.gov ) or telephone [(703) 603-3400] to report their location and contact information as soon as possible. Our offices are open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET, except holidays. Please advise F and M nonimmigrants to keep all relevant documents on their person – Advise students that in the event of an evacuation of the area, they bring with them their passport, student visa, Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status” and any other supporting documents that they possess to verify their legal status. Understand the critical record keeping requirements to keep in mind during emergency events . Specifically: Record Keeping: 8 CFR 214.3(g). Student Reporting: 8 CFR 214.3 (3)(g). Online Training: 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6) for F students; 8 CFR 214.2(m)(9)(v) for M students. Transfers: 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8). Additional Resources DHS urges all to plan for the unexpected, as emergencies can disrupt operations and affect the safety of your faculty, staff and students. However, the effects of a crisis can be lessened by planning, and a continuity of operations plan (COOP) will allow your school to continue critical operations until the crisis situation normalizes. SEVP and DHS strongly encourage schools to review the basic tenets of resiliency planning and use to the below resources to create a plan that works for your campus: Study in the State’s Campus Resilience at SEVP-certified School and Maintain F and M Status in Emergency Events DHS’s emergency preparedness, continuity planning and training information: Ready.gov Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Emergency Management Institute offers additional resources and training at FEMA's Training web page.

Those who need to prove their legal-visitor status—to employers, schools/universities or government agencies—can access their CBP arrival/departure record information online. CBP now gathers travelers’ arrival/departure information automatically from their electronic travel records. Now at the land border, travelers will be issued I-94s electronically and will no longer receive a paper I-94 stub. CBP encourages travelers requiring an I-94 to use the CBP Link mobile app or the CBP I-94 website to apply for their I-94. For Visa Waiver Program (VWP) travelers, an approved Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) is now required for entry and must be obtained prior to arriving at the U.S. land border. VWP travelers are encouraged to use the I-94 website or CBP Link mobile app to apply for an I-94 in advance. If a traveler would like a paper Form I-94, the traveler can print their own I-94 Form from the I-94 website using \"Get Most Recent I-94\" or by using the same option on the CBP Link mobile application. A paper form can be requested during the inspection process but all such requests will be accommodated in a secondary setting. If travelers need the information from their Form I-94 admission record to verify immigration status or employment authorization, they are encouraged to get their I-94 Number from the I-94 website or by using the CBP Link mobile app. Upon exiting the U.S., travelers issued a paper Form I-94 should surrender it to the commercial carrier, Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA), or to CBP upon departure. If you received an electronic I-94 upon arrival by air or sea or land and depart via land, your departure may not be recorded accurately. A departure will be recorded if you depart via land and re-enter the United States prior to the expiration date stamped in your passport. If you are not a resident of Canada or Mexico and you receive an electronic I-94 and depart via land but do not re-enter the United States prior to the expiration date stamped on your passport, you may want to travel with evidence of your departure into Canada or Mexico. Evidence of departure can include, but is not limited to, entry stamps in a passport, transportation tickets, pay stubs and/or other receipts. A traveler can request an entry stamp from CBSA when entering Canada or from the Instituto Nacional de Migracion (INM) when entering Mexico. Otherwise, when leaving via air or sea, CBP will record the departure electronically via manifest information provided by the carrier or by CBP. This automation streamlines the entry process for travelers, facilitates security and reduces federal costs. CBP estimates that the automated process will save the agency $15.5 million a year. For more information and for answers to frequently asked questions, see the I-94 Fact Sheet Notice Beginning in May 2019, I-94 numbers will be alphanumeric. Currently, I-94 numbers are 11 digits long and only contain numbers. In order to minimize program impact resulting from the depletion of numeric-only I-94 numbers and to create a long-term solution for the creation of new numbers, CBP is switching to alphanumeric I-94s. I-94 numbers will remain at 11 characters but will follow the format of 9 digits, followed by a letter in the 10th position, and a digit in the 11th position.

{"text": "More in This Section Close Minimum Wage Overtime Pay Earnings thresholds for the Executive, Administrative, and Professional exemption from minimum wage and overtime protections under the FLSA Hours Worked Recordkeeping Federal Wage Garnishments Direct Care Workers On April 26, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) published a final rule, Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees (link is external) , to update and revise the regulations issued under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, and professional employees. Revisions included increases to the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism for updating these earnings thresholds to reflect current earnings data. On November 15, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas vacated the Department’s 2024 final rule. Consequently, with regard to enforcement, the Department is applying the 2019 rule’s minimum salary level of $684 per week and total annual compensation requirement for highly compensated employees of $107,432 per year. Lawsuits regarding the 2024 final rule are currently pending in two other federal district courts, and the United States has filed a notice of appeal from the November 15 decision. The Department will update this notice with additional information as it becomes available. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments. Covered nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of not less than $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Overtime pay at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay is required after 40 hours of work in a workweek. FLSA Minimum Wage : The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Many states also have minimum wage laws. In cases where an employee is subject to both state and federal minimum wage laws, the employee is entitled to the higher minimum wage. FLSA Overtime : Covered nonexempt employees must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 per workweek (any fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours – seven consecutive 24-hour periods) at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay. There is no limit on the number of hours employees 16 years or older may work in any workweek. The FLSA does not require overtime pay for work on weekends, holidays, or regular days of rest, unless overtime is worked on such days. FLSA Tip Regulations : The FLSA allows employers who meet certain criteria to take a partial credit against their minimum wage obligations for tipped employees—those engaged in an occupation in which they customarily and regularly receive tips. Hours Worked : Hours worked ordinarily include all the time during which an employee is required to be on the employer’s premises, on duty, or at a prescribed workplace.

Dependents If you are an H-1B or an L-1 nonimmigrant and your dependent spouse or child is applying for an extension of their existing H-4 or L-2 status, or a change of status to H-4 or L-2, we will adjudicate your dependent spouse or child’s application together with your Form I-129 if the Form I-539 is packaged together with and properly filed at the same time and in the same location as your Form I-129. This means that an officer will review the H-4 or L-2 derivative’s Form I-539 after reviewing the principal’s Form I-129 and will take appropriate adjudicative action (that is, issue an approval, denial, RFE, NOID or refer for an investigation) after that adjudicative review. This includes a Form I-765 filed by your dependent spouse for an employment authorization document based on H-4 or L-2 status, as applicable. If your dependent’s associated applications are not properly submitted together with your Form I-129, we will adjudicate them separately.

Note: Form I-129H2A can only be filed online by uploading the completed PDF in a USCIS online account . USCIS will reject any paper filed Form I-129H2A petitions. If you are filing an H-2A petition by paper, you must continue to use Form I-129. The H-2A program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, a U.S. agent as described in the regulations, or an association of U.S. agricultural producers named as a joint employer, must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker , on a prospective worker’s behalf. Close All Open All Who May Qualify for H-2A Classification? To qualify for H-2A nonimmigrant classification, the petitioner must: Offer a job that is of a temporary or seasonal nature. Demonstrate that there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work. Show that employing H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. Generally, submit evidence of a single valid temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor with the H-2A petition. A petitioner electronically filing for unnamed beneficiaries using Form I-129H2A does not need to submit evidence of the valid TLC at the time of filing. (An additional limited exception to this requirement exists in certain “emergent circumstances.” See e.g., 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(x) for specific details.) *NOTE: As of Jan. 17, 2025, DHS regulations no longer require USCIS to consider whether the beneficiary is a national of a country that the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, has designated as eligible to participate in the H-2A program. H-2A Program Process for Paper Filed Petitions and/or Petitions Requesting Named Beneficiaries Step 1 : Petitioner submits temporary labor certification (TLC) application to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Before requesting H-2A classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for and receive an approved TLC for H-2A workers from DOL. For further information regarding the TLC requirements and process, see the Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor Web page Step 2 : Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS . After receiving an approved TLC for H-2A employment from DOL, the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit the original TLC as initial evidence with Form I-129. (See the instructions to Form I-129 for additional filing requirements.) Step 3 : Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission . After USCIS approves Form I-129, prospective H-2A workers who are outside the United States must: Apply for an H-2A visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or Directly seek admission to the United States in H-2A classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry, if a worker does not require a visa in cases where an H-2A visa is not required. H-2A Program Process for Electronically Filed Petitions Requesting Unnamed Beneficiaries Step 1 : Petitioner submits temporary labor certification (TLC) application to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Before requesting H-2A classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for a TLC for H-2A workers from DOL. For further information regarding the TLC requirements and process, see the Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor Web page Step 2 : Petitioner submits Form I-129H2A to USCIS . The petitioner may file Form I-129H2A with USCIS upon receiving a Notice of Acceptance from DOL* or may choose to wait until the underlying TLC has been approved before electronically filing their H-2A petition. (See the instructions to Form I-129H2A for additional filing requirements.)

However, even in cases where the petitioner files the H-2A petition after DOL acceptance and before approval, the TLC must be approved before USCIS completes the adjudication of the H-2A petition. Step 3 : Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission . After USCIS approves Form I-129H2A, prospective H-2A workers who are outside the United States must: Apply for an H-2A visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or Directly seek admission to the United States in H-2A classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry, if a worker does not require a visa in cases where an H-2A visa is not required. *NOTE : If you are filing an H-2A petition for unnamed beneficiaries after receiving a Notice of Acceptance but before approval of the TLC, USCIS will make necessary modifications to such petitions to reflect any modifications made by DOL and will ensure that no H-2A petition is approved before DOL approves the TLC. Effect of Prior Violation Determinations Under new H-2 regulations in effect on January 17, 2025, USCIS has the authority to deny H-2A petitions filed on or after January 17, 2025, if the petitioner or its predecessor has been found to have committed certain serious labor law violations or otherwise violated the requirements of the H-2A or H-2B program. Prospective denials under this provision will apply across both H-2 classifications regardless of whether the violation occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program. Whether the denial is mandatory or discretionary will depend on the nature of the past violation(s). For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv) and the Form I-129 Instructions. For the purposes of this denial authority, a criminal conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against certain individuals will be treated as a conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against the petitioner or successor in interest. For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv)(C). In addition, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C) with respect to how USCIS determines whether an employer is a successor in interest. Prohibition on Collection of Fees Related to H-2A Employment As a condition of approval of an H-2A petition, no job placement fee, fee or penalty for breach of contract, or other fee, penalty, or compensation (either direct or indirect) related to the H-2A employment (collectively, “prohibited fees”) may be collected at any time from a beneficiary of an H-2A or any person acting on the beneficiary’s behalf. Prohibited fees may include, but are not limited to, deduction or withholding of wages or salary, whether or not such deduction or withholding of wages or salary provides some benefit to the beneficiary. Passing a cost to the beneficiary that, by statute or applicable regulations is the responsibility of the petitioner, constitutes the collection of a prohibited fee. For additional information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi) and the Form I-129 Instructions. USCIS will deny or revoke the petition if we determine that the petitioner or any petitioner’s employee, agent, attorney, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service, or any employer or joint employer, collected, or entered into an agreement to collect, prohibited fees, as described above, whether before or after the filing of the petition. For information about the limited exceptions to a mandatory denial or revocation for prohibited fees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi) and the Form I-129 Instructions. If a petition is denied or revoked for prohibited fees, or if the petitioner withdraws the petition after USCIS issued a notice of intent to deny or revoke on this basis, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files within 1 year after the decision or acknowledgment of withdrawal if the denied or revoked petition was filed on or after January 17, 2025. After that 1-year period, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files for an additional 3 years unless each affected beneficiary, or their designee as appropriate, has been reimbursed in full.

After that 1-year period, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files for an additional 3 years unless each affected beneficiary, or their designee as appropriate, has been reimbursed in full. Denial on this basis will apply to petitions for both the H-2A and H-2B classifications regardless of whether the denial, revocation, or withdrawal occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program. The 3-year denial period will apply to petitioners whose petitions were previously denied, revoked, or withdrawn after being filed on or after January 17, 2025. For additional information, including regarding successor in interest determinations and reimbursement of designees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi) and the Form I-129 Instructions. Period of Stay Generally, USCIS may grant H-2A classification for up to the period of time authorized on the temporary labor certification (TLC). H-2A classification may be extended for qualifying employment in increments of up to 1 year each. A new, valid TLC covering the requested time must accompany each extension request. The maximum period of stay in H-2A classification is 3 years. A person who has held H-2A nonimmigrant status for a total of 3 years must depart and remain outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days before seeking readmission as an H-2A nonimmigrant. Additionally, previous time spent in other H or L classifications counts toward total H-2A time. “Resetting” the 3-year limit A qualifying absence from the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days at any time will result in the H-2A worker becoming eligible for a new 3-year maximum period of H-2A stay. Brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure during the required time abroad are not considered to be interruptive, but do not count towards fulfillment of the required 60-day minimum period of time abroad. To qualify, the petitioner must provide evidence documenting the worker’s relevant absence(s) from the United States, such as, but not limited to, arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad. A petitioner may choose to file a separate petition on behalf of the worker(s) for whom it is providing evidence of qualifying absences to reset the 3-year limit. While not required, filing separate petitions may help decrease delays in processing if USCIS requests additional evidence, and may help avoid a shortened validity period for other workers if one or more workers will reach the 3-year maximum period of stay during the requested validity period and USCIS is unable to verify the claimed period(s) of absence. Filing Multiple Petitions You generally may file one petition to request all of your H-2A workers associated with one temporary labor certification (with a limit of 25 named workers per petition). If you are required to file more than one petition (for instance if you are filing on behalf of both named and unnamed workers) or if you choose to file more than one petition: The total number of beneficiaries on your petitions may not exceed the total number of workers approved by the U.S. Department of Labor on the temporary labor certification; Each petition must be accompanied by a copy of the same temporary labor certification; and Please include an attachment noting that you are filing other petitions based on the same temporary labor certification. Family of H-2A Workers An H-2A worker’s spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Family members are not eligible for employment in the United States while in H-4 status. Employment-Related Notifications to USCIS OMB Control Number 1615-0107 Petitioners of H-2A workers must notify USCIS within 2 workdays if any of the following occur: Worker Never Reported for Work : The H-2A worker does not report for work within 5 work days of the latter of: The employment start date on the H-2A petition, or The start date established by the employer; Worker Stopped Reporting for Work: The H-2A worker leaves without notice and does not report for work for 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer; Termination: The H-2A worker is terminated before completing the H-2A labor or services for which he or she was hired; or Early Completion: The H-2A worker finishes the labor or services for which he or she was hired more than 30 days earlier than the end date specified in", "metadata": {"id": "71823946f3fba8bd", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers", "title": "H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "71823946f3fba8bd-2"}}

Note : USCIS defers to DOL’s definition of “workday.” According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), this generally means the period of time on any particular day when an employee begins and ends his or her “principal activities.” Petitioners must include the following information on the employment-related notification: The reason for the notification (for example, explain that the worker never reported for work,” or “stopped reporting for work,” or that the employment ended in “termination,” or “early completion”); The reason for untimely notification and evidence for good cause, if applicable; The USCIS receipt number of the approved H-2A petition; The petitioner’s information, including: Name Address Phone number Employer identification number (EIN) The employer’s information (if different from that of the petitioner): Name Address Phone number The H-2A worker’s information: Full Name Date of birth Place of birth Last known physical address and phone number Additionally, to help USCIS identify the H-2A worker, submit the following for each H-2A worker, if available: Social Security number Visa number Failure to Notify USCIS: A petitioner who fails to comply with these employment notification requirements, or fails to demonstrate good cause for untimely notification, may be required to pay $10 in liquidated damages for each instance of noncompliance. Note: The employment notification requirement is a petitioner obligation and does not represent an indication of wrongdoing on the part of the H-2A worker. Further, USCIS does not consider the information provided in a petitioner notification, standing alone, to be conclusive evidence regarding the worker’s current status. How do I notify USCIS?

{"text": "H-2B Temporary Non-Agricultural Workers The H-2B program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, or U.S. employer, or U.S. agent as described in the regulations, must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker , on a prospective worker’s behalf. Close All Open All Who May Qualify for H-2B Classification? To qualify for H-2B nonimmigrant classification, the petitioner must establish that: There are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work. Employing H-2B workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. Its need for the prospective worker’s services or labor is temporary, regardless of whether the underlying job can be described as temporary. The employer’s need is considered temporary if it is a(n): One-time occurrence – A petitioner claiming a one-time occurrence must show that it has: An employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created the need for a temporary worker. Not employed workers to perform the service or labor in the past, and will not need workers to perform the services or labor in the future; Seasonal need – A petitioner claiming a seasonal need must show that the service or labor for which it seeks workers is: Traditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or pattern; and Of a recurring nature. Note: You cannot claim a seasonal need if the time period when you do NOT need the service or labor is: Unpredictable; Subject to change; or Considered a vacation period for your permanent employees. Peak load need – A petitioner claiming a peak load need must show that it: Regularly employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place of employment; Needs to temporarily supplement its permanent staff at the place of employment due to a seasonal or short-term demand; and The temporary additions to staff will not become part of the employer's regular operation. Intermittent need – A petitioner claiming an intermittent need must show that it: Has not employed permanent or full-time workers to perform the services or labor; and Occasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to perform services or labor for short periods. H-2B petitioners must also provide a single valid temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), or, if the workers will be employed on Guam, from the Guam Department of Labor (Guam DOL). *NOTE: As of Jan. 17, 2025, DHS regulations no longer require USCIS to consider whether the beneficiary is a national of a country that the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, has designated as eligible to participate in the H-2B program. H-2B Cap There is a statutory numerical limit, or \"cap,\" on the total number of aliens who may be issued an H-2B visa or otherwise granted H-2B status during a fiscal year. Currently, Congress has set the H-2B cap at 66,000 per fiscal year, with 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the first half of the fiscal year (October 1 - March 31) and 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the second half of the fiscal year (April 1 - September 30). Any unused numbers from the first half of the fiscal year will be available for employers seeking to hire H-2B workers during the second half of the fiscal year. However, unused H-2B numbers from one fiscal year do not carry over into the next. Once the H-2B cap is reached, USCIS may only accept petitions for H-2B workers who are exempt from the H-2B cap. For additional information on the current H-2B cap, and on workers who are exempt from it, see the Cap Count for H-2B Nonimmigrants Web page H-2B Program Process Step 1 : Petitioner submits temporary labor certification application to DOL. Before requesting H-2B classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for and receive a temporary labor certification for H-2B workers with the U.S. Department of Labor (or Guam DOL if the employment will be in Guam).* For further information regarding the temporary labor certification application requirements and process, see the Foreign Labor Certification, Department of Labor and Foreign Labor Certification, Guam Department of Labor Web pages. Step 2 : Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS. After receiving a temporary labor certification for H-2B employment from either DOL or Guam DOL (if applicable), the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit the original temporary labor certification with Form I-129 (See the Form I-129 instructions for additional filing requirements).

Step 2 : Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS. After receiving a temporary labor certification for H-2B employment from either DOL or Guam DOL (if applicable), the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit the original temporary labor certification with Form I-129 (See the Form I-129 instructions for additional filing requirements). If the application for a temporary labor certification was processed in DOL’s FLAG system, the petitioner must include a printed copy of the electronic one-page “final determination” of the H-2B temporary labor certification approval with Form I-129. USCIS will consider a printed copy of the final determination as the original and approved temporary labor certification. If a petitioner has already submitted the original temporary labor certification with a previous Form I-129, submit a copy of the temporary labor certification and provide an explanation that includes the receipt number of the petition with which the original was filed, if available. Step 3: Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission. After USCIS approved Form I-129, prospective H-2B workers who are outside the United States must: Apply for an H-2B visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or Directly seek admission to the United States in H-2B classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry in cases where an H-2B visa is not required. *Note: If you are petitioning for one or more Canadian musicians that will be employed within a 50 mile radius from the U.S.-Canadian border for 30 days or less, you may skip Step 1 in the H-2B process. Reporting H-2B Fraud Anyone (including American workers and H-2B workers who suspect they or others may be the victim of H-2B fraud or abuse) can send us tips, alleged violations, and other relevant information about potential fraud or abuse using our online tip form Effect of Prior Violation Determinations Under the new regulations in effect on January 17, 2025, USCIS has the authority to deny H-2B petitions filed on or after January 17, 2025, if the petitioner or its predecessor has been found to have committed certain serious labor law violations or otherwise violated the requirements of the H-2A or H-2B program. Prospective denials under this provision will apply across both H-2 classifications regardless of whether the violation occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program. Whether the denial is mandatory or discretionary will depend on the nature of the past violation(s). For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv) and the Form I-129 Instructions. For the purposes of this denial authority, a criminal conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against certain individuals will be treated as a conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against the petitioner or successor in interest. For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv)(C). In addition, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D) with respect to how USCIS determines whether an employer is a successor in interest. Prohibition on Collection of Fees Related to H-2B Employment As a condition of approval of an H-2B petition, no job placement fee, fee or penalty for breach of contract, or other fee, penalty, or compensation (either direct or indirect) related to the H-2B employment (collectively, “prohibited fees”) may be collected at any time from a beneficiary of an H-2B or any person acting on the beneficiary’s behalf. Prohibited fees may include, but are not limited to, deduction or withholding of wages or salary, whether or not such deduction or withholding of wages or salary provides some benefit to the beneficiary. Passing a cost to the beneficiary that, by statute or applicable regulations is the responsibility of the petitioner, constitutes the collection of a prohibited fee. For additional information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B)-(D) and the Form I-129 Instructions. USCIS will deny or revoke the petition if we determine that the petitioner or any petitioner’s employee, agent, attorney, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service, or any employer or joint employer, collected, or entered into an agreement to collect, prohibited fees, as described above, whether before or after the filing of the petition. For information about the limited exceptions to a mandatory denial or revocation for prohibited fees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B)-(D) and the Form I-129 Instructions.

After that 1-year period, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files for an additional 3 years unless each affected beneficiary, or their designee as appropriate, has been reimbursed in full. Denial on this basis will apply to petitions for both the H-2A and H-2B classifications regardless of whether the denial, revocation, or withdrawal occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program.

For additional information, including regarding successor in interest determinations and reimbursement of designees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B)-(D) and the Form I-129 Instructions. Period of Stay Generally, USCIS may grant H-2B classification for up to the period of time authorized on the temporary labor certification. H-2B classification may be extended for qualifying employment in increments of up to 1 year each. A new, valid temporary labor certification covering the requested time must accompany each extension request. The maximum period of stay in H-2B classification is 3 years. A person who has held H-2B nonimmigrant status for a total of 3 years must depart and remain outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days before seeking readmission as an H-2B nonimmigrant. Additionally, previous time spent in other H or L classifications counts toward total H-2B time. “Resetting” the 3-year limit An absence from the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days at any time will result in the H-2B worker becoming eligible for a new 3-year maximum period of H-2B stay. Brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure during the required time abroad are not considered to be interruptive, but do not count towards fulfillment of the required 60-day minimum period of time abroad.

For more information, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M The O nonimmigrant classification are commonly referred to as: O-1A: Individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry); O-1B: Individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television industry; O-2: Individuals who will accompany an O-1 artist or athlete to assist in a specific event or performance; and O-3: Individuals who are the spouse or children of O-1 and O-2 visa holders. Close All Open All General Eligibility To qualify for an O-1 visa, you must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim, or a record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture and television industry, and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that you are one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the field. For detailed information regarding how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1A eligibility, including examples and considerations that are especially relevant for those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, see the USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 4, Section C , and Appendix: Satisfying the O-1A Evidentiary Requirements Extraordinary ability in the field of arts means distinction. Distinction means a high level of achievement in the field of the arts. This is evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that you are prominent, renowned, leading, or well-known in the field of arts. For detailed information on how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1B eligibility, including examples and considerations, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter D and Appendix: Satisfying the O-1B Evidentiary Requirements To qualify for an O-1 visa in the motion picture or television industry, you must demonstrate extraordinary achievement. This is evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition significantly above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that you are recognized as outstanding, notable or leading in the motion picture and/or television field. For detailed information on how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1B eligibility, including examples and considerations, see USCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter E and Appendix: Satisfying the O-1B Evidentiary Requirements To qualify for an O-2 visa, your assistance must be an “integral part” of the O-1A visa holder’s performance and you must have critical skills and experience with the O-1 visa holder that are not of a general nature and cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker. In the case of an O-2 visa holder in the motion picture or television industry, you must have skills and experience with the O-1 visa holder that are not of a general nature and which are critical either based on a pre-existing longstanding working relationship or, with respect to the specific production, because significant production (including pre- and post-production work) will take place both inside and outside the United States and your continuing participation is essential to the successful completion of the production. Application Process for an O-1 Visa A U.S. employer, U.S. agent, or foreign employer through a U.S. agent should file (see Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker ) on your behalf, along with the required evidence according to the form instructions. Your employer or agent cannot file the petition more than one year before they actually need your services.

{"text": "L-1A Intracompany Transferee Executive or Manager The L-1A nonimmigrant classification enables a U.S. employer to transfer an executive or manager from one of its affiliated foreign offices to one of its offices in the United States. This classification also enables a foreign company that does not yet have an affiliated U.S. office to send an executive or manager to the United States with the purpose of establishing one. The employer must file a Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker , with fee, on behalf of the employee. The following information describes some of the features and requirements of the L-1 nonimmigrant visa program. Close All Open All General Qualifications of the Employer and Employee To qualify for L-1 classification in this category, the employer must: Have a qualifying relationship with a foreign company (parent company, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate, collectively referred to as qualifying organizations ); and Currently be, or will be, doing business as an employer in the United States and in at least one other country directly or through a qualifying organization for the duration of the beneficiary’s stay in the United States as an L-1. While the business must be viable, there is no requirement that it be engaged in international trade. Doing business means the regular, systematic, and continuous provision of goods and/or services by a qualifying organization and does not include the mere presence of an agent or office of the qualifying organization in the United States and abroad. To qualify, the named employee must also: Generally have been working for a qualifying organization abroad for one continuous year within the three years immediately preceding his or her admission to the United States; and Be seeking to enter the United States to provide service in an executive managerial capacity for a branch of the same employer or one of its qualifying organizations. Executive capacity generally refers to the employee’s ability to make decisions of wide latitude without much oversight. Managerial capacity generally refers to the ability of the employee to supervise and control the work of professional employees and to manage the organization, or a department, subdivision, function, or component of the organization. It may also refer to the employee’s ability to manage an essential function of the organization at a high level, without direct supervision of others. See section 101(a)(44) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii) for complete definitions.

Family of L-1 Workers The transferring employee may be accompanied or followed by their spouse and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Spouses and children may seek admission in the L-2 nonimmigrant classification and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee.

Form I-129 Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants From April 30, 2018, to April 30, 2020, the California Service Center and the CBP Blaine, Washington, port of entry (POE) are participating in a joint agency pilot program for Canadian citizens seeking L-1 nonimmigrant status under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). For additional information, please visit the Form I-129/I-129S Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants Blanket Petitions Certain organizations may establish the required intracompany relationship in advance of filing individual L-1 petitions by filing a blanket petition. Eligibility for blanket L certification may be established if: The petitioner and each of the qualifying organizations are engaged in commercial trade or services; The petitioner has an office in the United States that has been doing business for one year or more; The petitioner has three or more domestic and foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates; and The petitioner along with the other qualifying organizations meet one of the following criteria: Have obtained at least 10 L-1 approvals during the previous 12-month period; Have U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual sales of at least $25 million; or Have a U.S. work force of at least 1,000 employees. The approval of a blanket L petition does not guarantee that an employee will be granted L-1A classification. It does, however, provide the employer with the flexibility to transfer eligible employees to the United States quickly and with short notice without having to file an individual petition with USCIS. Where an L-1 visa is required In most cases, once the blanket petition has been approved, the employer need only complete Form, I-129S,Nonimmigrant Petition Based on Blanket L Petition , and send it to the employee along with a copy of the blanket petition Approval Notice and other required evidence, so that the employee may present it to a consular officer in connection with an application for an L-1 visa.

Please refer to CBP’s website for additional information and/or requirements for applying for admission into the United States.

{"text": "L-1B Intracompany Transferee Specialized Knowledge The L-1B nonimmigrant classification enables a U.S. employer to transfer a professional employee with specialized knowledge relating to the organization’s interests from one of its affiliated foreign offices to one of its offices in the United States. This classification also enables a foreign company that does not yet have an affiliated U.S. office to send a specialized knowledge employee to the United States to help establish one. The employer must file Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker with fee, on behalf of the employee. Close All Open All General Qualifications of the Employer and Employee To qualify for L-1 classification in this category, the employer must: Have a qualifying relationship with a foreign company (parent company, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate, collectively referred to as qualifying organizations); and Currently be, or will be, doing business as an employer in the United States and in at least one other country directly or through a qualifying organization for the duration of the beneficiary’s stay in the United States as an L-1. While the business must be viable, there is no requirement that it be engaged in international trade. Doing business means the regular, systematic, and continuous provision of goods and/or services by a qualifying organization and does not include the mere presence of an agent or office of the qualifying organization in the United States and abroad. To qualify, the named employee must also: Generally have been working for a qualifying organization abroad for one continuous year within the three years immediately preceding his or her admission to the United States; and Be seeking to enter the United States to provide services in a specialized knowledge capacity to a branch of the same employer or one of its qualifying organizations. Specialized knowledge means either special knowledge possessed by an individual of the petitioning organization’s product, service, research, equipment, techniques, management, or other interests and its application in international markets, or an advanced level of knowledge or expertise in the organization’s processes and procedures (See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(D)). L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2004 The L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2004 applies to all petitions filed on or after June 6, 2005, and is directed particularly to those filed on behalf of L-1B employees who will be stationed primarily at the worksite of an of an employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate, subsidiary, or parent. In order for the employee to qualify for L-1B classification in this situation, the petitioning employer must show that: The employee will not be principally controlled or supervised by such an unaffiliated employer; and The work being provided by the employee is not considered to be labor for hire by such an unaffiliated employer. See INA 214(c)(2)(F) and Chapter 32.3(c) of the USCIS Adjudicator’s Field Manual, available in the \" Laws \" section of the website. New Offices For foreign employers seeking to send an employee with specialized knowledge to the United States to be employed in a qualifying new office, the employer must show that: The employer has secured sufficient physical premises to house the new office ; and The employer has the financial ability to compensate the employee and begin doing business in the United States. See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(3)(vi) for details. Period of Stay Qualified employees entering the United States to establish a new office will be allowed a maximum initial stay of one year. All other qualified employees will be allowed a maximum initial stay of three years. For all L-1B employees, requests for extension of stay may be granted in increments of up to an additional two years, until the employee has reached the maximum limit of five years. Family of L-1 Workers The transferring employee may be accompanied or followed by their spouse and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Spouses and children may seek admission in the L-2 nonimmigrant classification and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee. If these family members are already in the United States and seeking change of status to or extension of stay in the L-2 classification, they may apply collectively, with fee, using Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Status Spouses of L-1 workers in valid L-2S nonimmigrant status are considered employment authorized incident to status.

Form I-129 Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants From April 30, 2018, to April 30, 2020, the California Service Center and the CBP Blaine, Washington, port of entry (POE) are participating in a joint agency pilot program for Canadian citizens seeking L-1 nonimmigrant status under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). For additional information, please visit the Form I-129/I-129S Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants Blanket Petitions Certain organizations may establish the required intracompany relationship in advance of filing individual L-1 petitions by filing a blanket petition. Eligibility for blanket L certification may be established if: The petitioner and each of the qualifying organizations are engaged in commercial trade or services; The petitioner has an office in the United States which has been doing business for one year or more; The petitioner has three or more domestic and foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates; and The petitioner along with the other qualifying organizations, collectively, meet one of the following criteria: Have obtained at least 10 L-1 approvals during the previous 12-month period; Have U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual sales of at least $25 million; or Have a U.S. work force of at least 1,000 employees. The approval of a blanket L petition does not guarantee that an employee will be granted L-1B classification. It does, however, provide the employer with the flexibility to transfer eligible employees to the United States without having to file an individual petition with USCIS. In order to qualify under the blanket petitioning process, the employee having specialized knowledge must also be a professional. See 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(E). Where an L-1 visa is required In most cases, once the blanket petition has been approved, the employer need only complete a Form I-129S, Nonimmigrant Petition Based on Blanket L Petition , and send it to the employee along with a copy of the blanket petition Approval Notice and other required evidence, so that the employee may present it to a U.S. consular officer in connection with an application for an L-1 visa. Canadians with an approved blanket petition seeking L-1 classification Canadian citizens, who are exempt from the L-1 visa requirement, may present the completed Form I-129S and supporting documentation to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer at certain POEs on the United States-Canada land border or at a United States pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station in Canada, in connection with an application for admission to the United States in L-1 status.

{"text": "Green Card Processes and Procedures Each Green Card category have specific steps and procedures to follow. Listed below are some general processes and procedures to help you apply either while in the United States (known as “adjustment of status”) or while outside the United States (known as “consular processing”). Page Title Summary Green Card Eligibility Categories Determine if you are eligible for permanent resident status. Review the eligibility requirements needed before applying for your Green Card. Adjustment of Status Adjusting your status to a permanent resident is the process immigrants use to get a Green Card while in the United States. Consular Processing Consular processing is the method immigrants use to get their Green Card when outside the United States or when ineligible to adjust status in the United States. Concurrent Filing When getting a Green Card through employment, family, or as a special immigrant, someone may need to file a petition for you. Concurrent filing is generally when the immigrant petition is filed at the same time you file your application to get a Green Card. Learn what concurrent filing is and what categories are eligible to concurrently file. Visa Availability and Priority Dates In general, a visa must be available for you before you can apply for a Green Card. In some categories, visas are always available, while in others, there are a limited number. Priority dates are given to immigrants waiting in line to get an immigrant visa and determine when a visa becomes available. Learn how to tell if a visa is available to you. Travel Documents Learn more about if and when you can travel outside the United States after applying for a Green Card or once you have a Green Card. You can also learn how to apply for advance parole, a Refugee Travel Document, and a re-entry permit. Employment Authorization Document Learn more about if you are eligible for work authorization in the United States and how to apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Immigration Medical Examinations Most applications for a Green Card require a medical exam. Learn about who must complete a medical exam and the specific forms and procedures that you must follow. Affidavit of Support An affidavit of support is a form that a sponsor files on your behalf when you are applying for a Green Card or immigrant visa. It is required for some (but not all) categories of immigrants before they can become a permanent resident of the United States. The purpose of the form is to show you have the financial means to live in the United States without needing welfare or financial benefits from the U.S. government. Public Charge To get a Green Card, most immigrants must show that they will not become a public charge. Learn more about public charge Child Status Protection Act Your age can determine whether you are eligible for a Green Card as a “child.” The Child Status Protection Act, often referred to as CSPA, allows certain children who have aged out (become 21 years or older) after an immigrant petition has been filed to still be eligible for a Green Card through their parents. Transfer of Underlying Basis An adjustment of status applicant occasionally prefers to have their pending application considered under a different immigrant category. For more information about transferring, see the USCIS Policy Manual To transfer the basis of your pending adjustment of status application to a different eligibility category, you generally must submit a written request to the USCIS office with jurisdiction over the application. USCIS has also established a new location that should be used for submitting transfer requests between employment-based categories.

{"text": "I-130, Petition for Alien Relative Use this form if you (the petitioner) are a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national (who is not a U.S. citizen) and you need to establish your qualifying relationship with an eligible alien relative (the beneficiary) who wishes to come to or stay in the United States permanently and apply for the Permanent Resident Card (also called a Green Card). You must select only 1 option for Part 4 (Question 61 or 62) to indicate whether the beneficiary will seek adjustment of status inside the United States or consular processing abroad. Do not complete both questions, and do not leave this section blank. File Online Processing Information Submitting Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative , is the first step to help an eligible relative apply to immigrate to the United States and apply for a Green Card. The filing or approval of this petition does not give your relative any immigration status or benefit. We will generally approve your Form I-130 if you can establish a qualifying relationship between you and your relative that allows them to immigrate to the United States. Generally, after we approve the petition, your relative may apply for a Green Card. If your relative is already in the United States and an immigrant visa is available, they may be eligible to apply for their Green Card by filing Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status Certain relatives must wait until an immigrant visa number is available before they can file Form I-485 (to adjust their status if they are in the United States) or request an immigrant visa at an embassy or consulate through consular processing (if they are outside the United States). However, if your relative qualifies as an immediate relative, an immigrant visa is always available. If your relative is already in the United States but they are not eligible to apply for the Green Card by filing Form I-485, the relative may be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa with the U.S. Department of State at a U.S. embassy or consulate through consular processing. For more information on eligibility and the process to apply for a Green Card, please visit our Green Card Eligibility Categories page.

Form I-864 is a legally binding contract with the U.S. government to financially support the sponsored alien. If a sponsored alien receives means-tested public benefits, the benefit granting agency can request repayment from the sponsor to recoup the cost of any benefits paid. If the sponsor fails to repay the cost of the means-tested public benefits, the benefit granting agency may sue the sponsor, who will be liable for the cost of the benefits, legal fees, and other associated costs. Sponsors should not take on this obligation if they are not prepared to follow through on the financial commitment. Most family-based immigrants and some employment-based immigrants use this form to show they have adequate means of financial support and are not likely to rely on the U.S. government for financial support.

{"text": "I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records Alert Type info Alert: On Nov. 20, 2025, USCIS announced a Federal Register notice that will increase certain immigration-related H.R. 1 fees for fiscal year 2026. These fee adjustments reflect the amount of inflation from July 2024 through July 2025. The new inflation-adjusted H.R. 1 fees are effective Jan. 1, 2026. If you submit a benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, that requires one of these H.R. 1 fees, you must include the new fee for the specific benefit you are requesting. We will reject any affected immigration benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, without the proper filing fee. See the web alert for more information. Alert Type info ALERT: New Immigration Parole Fee We are implementing a new immigration parole fee required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill. The fee is $1,000 for FY 2025 and is subject to annual adjustments for inflation. Do not pay the immigration parole fee when you submit Form I-131 to USCIS. Beginning on Oct. 16, 2025, if you are in the United States and we determine that we can approve your request for parole or re-parole and that it requires payment of the immigration parole fee, we will notify you that you must pay this fee before we can approve your request. The notice we send you will contain payment instructions and a deadline. We will not grant parole unless you pay the immigration parole fee as instructed and within the specified time period. See our web alert for more information. Alert Type info ALERT: Re-Parole Process for Certain Ukrainian Citizens and Their Immediate Family Members On Feb. 27, 2024, we announced a process for eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to apply for re-parole so they can continue to temporarily remain in the United States. We encourage eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to submit their re-parole requests to us no earlier than 180 days (6 months) before the expiration of their current period of parole . You can find your parole expiration date on your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record , issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when you were paroled into the United States. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of parole and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your re-parole request. If you submit a request for re-parole more than 180 days before the expiration of your current period of parole, we may reject or deny your re-parole application without refunding the filing fees . Please note that filing earlier than 180 days before your current parole expiration date will not result in a faster decision. Use this form to apply for travel documents, parole documents, or arrival/departure records. Travel Documents You may use this form to apply for a reentry permit, refugee travel document, TPS travel authorization document, advance parole document, or advance permission to travel for Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) long-term residents. If we approve your Form I-131 and you are a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiary in the United States who wishes to travel outside the United States, we will issue you Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by an Alien to the United States. If we approve your Form I-131 and your initial application for TPS (Form I-821) is still pending, we will issue you a Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document. If you are a TPS beneficiary or have a pending initial TPS application, you should carefully read the Form I-131 Instructions. These instructions explain certain risks you may face if you are outside the United States while we are considering your TPS re-registration or initial application, such as missing important requests for evidence or other notices or being denied TPS while you are outside the United States.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will determine at its discretion during inspection whether you may be admitted into TPS. You may be admitted into TPS if you travel and return in accordance with your TPS travel authorization, your TPS remains valid, and you are not inadmissible for certain criminal or security grounds that are mandatory ineligibility grounds for TPS.

Initial Parole Documents You may use this form to apply for parole into the United States for yourself or someone else who is an alien and who is currently outside the United States based on urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. A parole request from outside the United States may fall under an existing program or process, such as the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program, parole under the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, or the Family Reunification Task Force (FRTF) process. Your initial parole document may be a boarding foil that is placed in your passport, or it may be a Form I-512L travel document. Arrival/Departure Records for Parole in Place If you are an alien who is currently inside the United States and you are present without having been admitted, you may use this form to apply for parole in place based on urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, including requests for military parole in place and the FRTF process. Arrival/Departure Records for Re-Parole If you are an alien who is inside the United States, who was previously granted parole, and who needs an additional period of parole, then you may use this form to apply for re-parole based on urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit. If we authorize your re-parole, you will be issued a Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Record with a new Admit Until Date or Parole Until Date. Generally, the DHS component that initially authorized parole has jurisdiction over any request for re-parole, unless DHS or USCIS provides alternate filing instructions. Please see the Memorandum of Agreement between USCIS, ICE, and CBP for more information about each agency’s jurisdiction over re-parole requests. Form I-131 includes filing instructions for specific types of re-parole requests processed by USCIS. Your re-parole request may fall under an existing program or process, such as for those who were initially paroled under the family reunification parole processes, certain Afghans paroled into the United States after July 31, 2021, certain Ukrainians paroled into the United States after Feb. 11, 2022, the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program, Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, Central American Minors Program, FRTF Process, or military parole in place.

Do not submit a fee, and instead submit a properly completed Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver , or written request, and documentation to support the fee waiver request. Filing Tips: Review our Tips for Filing Forms by Mail page for information on how to ensure we will accept your form. Don’t forget to sign your form. We will reject any unsigned form. Special Instructions Biometrics : Applicants who file Form N-400 must generally submit biometrics unless we waive the requirement. An applicant who is required to appear at an application support center (ASC) to submit biometrics will receive a notice of their scheduled appointment. If we determine you are eligible for naturalization, we may use the photograph taken at the ASC on your Certificate of Naturalization. Therefore, we recommend that, on the day of your ASC appointment, you dress in clothing that is acceptable for display on your Certificate of Naturalization. We will not reject a photograph based solely on your desire to modify the photograph shown on your certificate. Photographs : Based on processing needs, you may need to submit physical passport photographs after you have already filed your Form N-400. We will send you a request for physical photographs with instructions on how to submit them. Attorney or representative : You may be represented, at no expense to the U.S. government, by an attorney or other duly authorized or accredited representative. Your representative must submit Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative , with your Form N-400. They may also submit Form G-28 at the time of your interview. Lost or Expiring Permanent Resident Card (Green Card): Effective Dec. 12, 2022, after you properly file Form N-400, you will receive a Form N-400 receipt notice that automatically extends your Green Card for 2 years from the “Card Expires” date on your Green Card. This notice will serve as proof that we have extended your Green Card, which is evidence of your lawful permanent resident status. The notice should be presented together with your Green Card. If you lose your Green Card, you generally must still file Form I-90 even if you have applied for naturalization. If you have a Form N-400 receipt notice that automatically extends the validity of your Green Card, but your notice has been destroyed or lost, then you generally must file Form I-90 to renew your expiring Green Card. Biometrics for Service Members We will review your application and conduct required background and security checks, which may include you providing us with your fingerprints. This can be done in 1 of these ways: If you were fingerprinted for a previous immigration application, we will use these fingerprints, if available. If you are stationed outside the United States, you may submit 2 properly completed FD-258 fingerprint cards and 2 passport-style photos", "metadata": {"id": "a0399e34e8426c83", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/n-400", "title": "Application for Naturalization | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "a0399e34e8426c83-3"}}

{"text": "Refugees Under United States law, a refugee is someone who: Is located outside of the United States Is of special humanitarian concern to the United States Demonstrates that they were persecuted or fear persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group Is not firmly resettled in another country Is admissible to the United States A refugee does not include anyone who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. For the legal definition of refugee, see section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Close All Open All The Refugee Process You must receive a referral to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for consideration as a refugee. For more information on the referral criteria, see the USRAP Consultations and Worldwide Processing Priorities page. If you receive a referral, you will receive help filling out your application and then be interviewed abroad by a USCIS officer who will determine whether you are eligible for refugee resettlement. For more information about eligibility, see our Refugee Eligibility Determination page. Your case may include your spouse, child (unmarried and under 21 years of age), and in some limited circumstances, other family members. You may include a same-sex spouse in your application provided that you and your spouse are legally married. As a general matter, USCIS looks to the law of the place where the marriage took place when determining whether it is valid for immigration law purposes. Same-sex partners who are not married but who are qualified to access the U.S. Refugee Admissions under one of the three designated worldwide processing priorities may have their cases cross-referenced so that they can be interviewed at the same time and, if approved by USCIS, resettled in the same geographic area in the United States. There is no fee to apply for refugee status. The information you provide will not be shared with your home country. For more information about USRAP and the referral process, see our USRAP Consultations and Worldwide Processing Priorities page. Coming to the United States If you are approved as a refugee, you will receive a medical exam, a cultural orientation, help with your travel plans, and a loan for your travel to the United States.

For more information about bringing your family to the United States, see our Family of Refugees and Asylees page. You may also be eligible to file an Affidavit of Relationship for your spouse, child (unmarried, under 21), or parents. The Affidavit of Relationship is the form used to reunite refugees and asylees with close relatives who are determined to be refugees but are outside the United States.

Reg. 43225 (Sept. 8, 2025). Additional information is available on the TPS Venezuela page. Be aware that litigation related updates are possible and check that page for the latest information. Close All Open All What is TPS The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a foreign country for TPS due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately. USCIS may grant TPS to eligible nationals of certain countries (or parts of countries), who are already in the United States. Eligible individuals without nationality who last resided in the designated country may also be granted TPS. The Secretary may designate a country for TPS due to the following temporary conditions in the country: Ongoing armed conflict (such as civil war) An environmental disaster (such as earthquake or hurricane), or an epidemic Other extraordinary and temporary conditions During a designated period, individuals who are TPS beneficiaries or who are found preliminarily eligible for TPS upon initial review of their cases ( prima facie eligible): Are not removable from the United States Can obtain an employment authorization document (EAD) May be granted travel authorization Once granted TPS, an individual also cannot be detained by DHS on the basis of his or her immigration status in the United States. TPS is a temporary benefit that does not lead to lawful permanent resident status or give any other immigration status. However, registration for TPS does not prevent you from: Applying for nonimmigrant status Filing for adjustment of status based on an immigrant petition Applying for any other immigration benefit or protection for which you may be eligible PLEASE NOTE: To be granted any other immigration benefit you must still meet all the eligibility requirements for that particular benefit. An application for TPS does not affect an application for asylum or any other immigration benefit and vice versa. Denial of an application for asylum or any other immigration benefit does not affect your ability to register for TPS, although the grounds of denial of that application may also lead to denial of TPS. Countries Currently Designated for TPS Select the country link for additional specific country information. Burma (Myanmar) El Salvador Ethiopia Haiti Lebanon Somalia South Sudan Sudan Syria Ukraine Venezuela Yemen Eligibility Requirements To be eligible for TPS, you must: Be a national of a country designated for TPS, or a person without nationality who last habitually resided in the designated country; File during the open initial registration or re-registration period, or you meet the requirements for late initial filing during any extension of your country’s TPS designation (Late initial filers see ‘Filing Late’ section below); Have been continuously physically present (CPP) in the United States since the effective date of the most recent designation date of your country; and Have been continuously residing (CR) in the United States since the date specified for your country.

You may also file your Form I-765 request separately at a later date. Filing Form I-821 with Form I-765 may help you receive your EAD more promptly if you are eligible. You may also file Form I-765 online if filing concurrently with Form I-821 online. When you apply, if you are aware that a relevant ground of inadmissibility applies to you and you need a waiver to obtain TPS, please include a Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility , with your TPS application package. However, you do not need to file a new Form I-601 for an incident that USCIS has already waived with a prior TPS application.

When and Where to File For information about when and where you must file your TPS application, please see the country specific pages to the left. Application Process Step 1: File Your Application Once you have prepared your TPS package with the forms, evidence and filing fees (or request for a fee waiver), you will need to send it to the address indicated on your TPS country page to the left. Please make sure you sign your application and include the correct fee amount (or fee waiver request). These are the two of the most common mistakes USCIS receives on TPS applications. Please look above at the fee chart to see what fees you must pay (a properly documented fee waiver request may be submitted). If you do not pay the proper fees (or submit a proper fee waiver request), your application will be rejected. Step 2: USCIS Receives Your Application When USCIS receives your application, we will review it for completeness and for the proper fees or a properly documented fee waiver request. If your case meets the basic acceptance criteria, your application will be entered into our system and we will send you a receipt notice. At the top of this notice you will find a receipt number which can be used to check the status of your case online. If you do not receive your receipt notice within three weeks of filing, you can call the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283 to request assistance. If your application is rejected at the initial review stage, you may re-file within the registration period after correcting the problems described in the USCIS notification. If your application was rejected because we determined you were not eligible for a fee waiver, you may submit a new TPS package. Go to the ‘Fee Waiver’ section above for more information. Step 3: USCIS Contacts You If USCIS needs to collect your photograph, signature, and/or fingerprints (these are called biometrics), USCIS will send you an appointment notice to have your biometrics captured at an Application Support Center ( ASC ). Every TPS applicant over 14 years old must have their biometrics collected. Biometrics are required for identity verification, background checks and the production of an EAD, if one has been requested. In certain situations, such as when it’s impossible to take a fingerprint, USCIS can waive the collection of biometrics. In some cases, we may be able to reuse the biometrics previously collected in association with your previous TPS application. Even if you do not need to attend an ASC appointment, you still need to pay the biometrics fee (if required) to help cover costs associated with reusing your biometrics. Step 4: Go to the ASC When you report to an ASC, you must bring: Evidence of nationality and identity with a photograph of you, such as a passport Your receipt notice Your ASC appointment notice Your current EAD, if you already have one If you cannot make your scheduled appointment, you may reschedule. To reschedule an ASC appointment, make a copy of your appointment notice to retain for your records, then mail the original notice with your rescheduling request to the ASC address listed on the notice. You should submit your request for rescheduling as soon as you know you have an unavoidable conflict on your scheduled ASC date. A new appointment notice will be sent to you by mail. Please note that rescheduling a biometrics appointment may cause the adjudication of your application to be delayed.

Then... Applying for TPS for the first time and seeking an EAD USCIS will review your case to determine whether you are eligible to work before we make a final decision on your TPS application. If you are found to be eligible upon initial review of your TPS application (prima facie eligible) you will receive an EAD. Note: If your application is denied and you choose to appeal to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) or request review of your application by an immigration judge, your EAD will be extended while you are waiting for a decision. If your EAD expires, to request an extension of your EAD, you must file a Form I-765 along with evidence of your appeal to the AAO or that you have requested an immigration judge to review your TPS application. Re-Registering for TPS and seeking an EAD You will receive your new EAD when your entire TPS package is adjudicated. USCIS makes every effort to avoid backlogs at this step, but we urge you to remember that USCIS may experience a higher volume of applications in the first few months of a registration period. Step 6: USCIS Adjudicates the Application During this phase, we may ask you for additional documents to establish your eligibility for TPS. If you receive a request for evidence (RFE) or a notice of intent to deny, it is extremely important that you respond immediately to avoid processing delays and possible denial for failure to timely respond. Upon completion of your case, USCIS will notify you if your request for TPS is granted or denied. If one of the waivable grounds of inadmissibility applies to you, USCIS will give you an opportunity to submit a Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility if you did not include this with your TPS package. Please submit this form within the time frame specified in the USCIS notice, or your case will be denied. Step 7: USCIS Approves or Denies the Application If your application for TPS is… Then… Approved and you filed an initial application USCIS will send you an approval notice and an EAD, if you requested one and haven’t received it before this step. Approved and you filed a re-registration application USCIS will send you an approval notice if you do not request an EAD. USCIS will send you a new EAD if you do request one. Denied USCIS will send you a letter indicating the reason for your denial and, if applicable, provide you with the opportunity to appeal the denial Maintaining TPS Once you are granted TPS, you must re-register during each re-registration period to maintain TPS benefits. This applies to all TPS beneficiaries, including those who were initially granted by USCIS, an Immigration Judge, or the BIA. Follow the instructions above to apply for re-registration. Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension If you have and maintain TPS, you may receive an extension of your EAD: Through publication of a Federal Register notice extending the TPS designation of your country, if the Federal Register notice also authorizes an extension of existing EADs (see your country’s TPS page to the left for details); Through notification of extension, typically when USCIS sends you a Form I-797, Notice of Action; or Through the automatic EAD extensions announced through temporary final rules in May 2022 and", "metadata": {"id": "b2e1695d45b9808d", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status", "title": "Temporary Protected Status | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "b2e1695d45b9808d-4"}}

For more information, including eligibility requirements and showing proof of identity, visit the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page. For more information, please see the country-specific pages to the left. Filing Late Late Re-Registration for TPS USCIS may accept a late re-registration application if you have good cause for filing after the end of the re-registration period of your country. You must submit a letter that explains your reason for filing late with your re-registration application. If you file your TPS re-registration application late, processing may be delayed and can lead to gaps in your work authorization. Late Initial Filing for TPS You can apply for TPS for the first time during an extension of your country’s TPS designation period. If you qualify to file your initial TPS application late, you must still independently meet all the TPS eligibility requirements listed in the Eligibility section above. To qualify to file your initial TPS application late, you must meet at least one of the late initial filing conditions below: During either the initial registration period of your country’s designation or during any subsequent initial registration period if your country was re-designated you met one of the following conditions, and you register while the condition still exists or within a 60-day period immediately following the expiration or termination of such condition You were a nonimmigrant, were granted voluntary departure status, or any relief from removal You had an application for change of status, adjustment of status, asylum, voluntary departure, or any relief from removal which was pending or subject to further review or appeal You were a parolee or had a pending request for re-parole You are a spouse of an individual who is currently eligible for TPS During either the initial registration period of your country’s designation or during any subsequent initial registration period if your country was re-designated you were a child of an individual who is currently eligible for TPS. There is no time limitation on filing if you meet this condition. So if your parent is currently eligible for TPS and you were his or her child (unmarried and under 21 years old) at any time during a TPS initial registration period for your country, you may still be eligible for late initial filing even if you are now over 21 years old or married. You may file during an extension of your TPS designated country. Please check your country-specific web page for the dates of the initial registration period or periods that apply for late initial filing. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot obtain TPS as a derivative because your parent or child has TPS. Travel If you have TPS and wish to travel outside the United States, you must apply for travel authorization. If we approve your request, we will issue you a Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by an Alien to the United States, to serve as evidence of DHS’s prior consent to your travel outside the United States. If a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer determines that you are eligible, they will admit you into TPS upon your return. Note that if you were previously granted parole, this admission will render you ineligible for a new period of parole. If we are still adjudicating your application for TPS, and you wish to travel outside the United States, you must apply for travel authorization. If we approve your request for travel authorization, we will issue you a Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, to serve as evidence of DHS’s prior consent to your travel outside the United States. To apply for TPS travel authorization or advance parole, you must file Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records . If you are filing Form I-131 together with Form I-821, send your forms to the address listed for your country. Then click on the name of your country.)

If you have a pending TPS application and leave the United States without first obtaining advance parole, we may deny your application for TPS, and you may not be able to reenter the United States. If we are still adjudicating your TPS application, you may miss important USCIS notices, such as Requests for Additional Evidence, while you are outside the United States. If you do not respond to these requests, we may deny your application. We encourage you to read and understand the travel warning on Form I-131 before you request TPS travel authorization or advance parole. You may want to seek legal advice before you request TPS travel authorization or advance parole for travel. Change of Address If your address changes after you file your application, you must notify USCIS immediately. For information about how to notify USCIS go to www.uscis.gov/addresschange TPS Granted by an Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals Step 1: If an Immigration Judge (IJ) or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) granted you TPS, you must provide USCIS with proof of the TPS grant (such as a final order from the IJ or final decision from the BIA) when you file for your first TPS benefit (such as an EAD, travel authorization, or with your first TPS re-registration application filed with USCIS). You should also submit a copy of the I-821 TPS application that the IJ or the BIA approved.

Appealing a Denial If USCIS denies your application, you will be informed in the denial notice whether you have 30 days to appeal to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). If you do not have the right to appeal because you were placed in removal proceedings when your TPS application was denied by USCIS, you can request that the immigration judge adjudicate your TPS application. You may also choose to file a motion to reconsider with the Service Center that adjudicated your TPS application by submitting: Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion The correct filing fee, see form instructions . Or Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver (or written request) if you are unable to pay If USCIS denies your TPS application, we recommend that you consult with an accredited legal representative to determine whether you should pursue an appeal or motion.

Note on Seeking Asylum : Being granted and maintaining TPS status until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the one year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States, if the one-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv). Avoid Scams Please be aware that some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file TPS forms. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. We want to ensure that all potential TPS applicants know how to obtain legitimate, accurate legal advice and assistance. A list of accredited representatives and free or low-cost legal providers is available on the USCIS website on the finding legal advice web page. We don’t want you to become a victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. Only an attorney or an accredited representative working for a Department of Justice (DOJ) recognized organization can give you legal advice. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources.

{"text": "I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal Alert Type info Alert: On Nov. 20, 2025, USCIS announced a Federal Register notice that will increase certain immigration-related H.R. 1 fees for fiscal year 2026. These fee adjustments reflect the amount of inflation from July 2024 through July 2025. The new inflation-adjusted H.R. 1 fees are effective Jan. 1, 2026. If you submit a benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, that requires one of these H.R. 1 fees, you must include the new fee for the specific benefit you are requesting. We will reject any affected immigration benefit request postmarked on or after Jan. 1, 2026, without the proper filing fee. See the web alert for more information. Alert Type info ALERT: On Oct. 1, 2025, we began sending notices to all aliens with a pending Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, who are required to pay the new Annual Asylum Fee (AAF) as provided in the July 22, 2025 Federal Register notice titled “ USCIS Immigration Fees Required by HR-1 Reconciliation Bill .” We also sent notices to any representatives of these aliens listed on Form G-28. On Oct. 30, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al. , SAG-25-03299 (D. Md.), temporarily stayed the AAF implementation provisions by USCIS. USCIS strongly disagrees with the Court’s order but will follow its terms pending possible further judicial review. In accordance with the Oct. 30 order, USCIS has paused the issuance of AAF notices pending further litigation developments. Any applicant who has received a notice from USCIS instructing him or her to pay the AAF may disregard that notice while the temporary stay is in place. USCIS will not refund previously paid annual asylum fees, and applicants who paid the fee should retain their receipts. USCIS will issue updated instructions on payment of the AAF pending further litigation developments. Alert Type info ALERT : Applying for Asylum with USCIS for Ms. L.

Where to File Who May File with USCIS You may file your affirmative Form I-589 with USCIS if you are not a U.S. citizen, are physically present in the United States, and: You have never been issued an A-Number; or You have been issued an A-Number, but you are not currently in Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) proceedings (see below for more information about how to check whether you are in EOIR proceedings); or You are in removal proceedings and are currently, or were previously determined to be, an \"unaccompanied alien child\" (UAC). You may not file your Form I-589 with USCIS if you are currently in proceedings with EOIR, unless you are currently, or were previously determined to be, a UAC as defined in 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2). You must file your Form I-589 with EOIR if you are in proceedings before an immigration judge or before the Board of Immigration Appeals and you are not and were never determined to be a UAC. These steps will help you determine whether you are in EOIR proceedings: Have you been issued an \"Alien Number\" (A-Number)? The A-Number begins with the letter “A” and is followed by 8 or 9 digits (for example, A123456789). This number is printed on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and EOIR correspondence and documents, including USCIS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) documents. If you have been issued an A-Number, check whether you are in EOIR proceedings by: Calling the EOIR Automated Case Information Hotline toll-free in the United States at 800-898-7180 (TDD 800-828-1120) or 304-625-2050 (local toll call); or Checking the EOIR Automated Case Information online system. If the EOIR hotline or online system has information regarding your name and next hearing date, then your Form I-862, Notice to Appear (NTA), has been filed and docketed with EOIR and you are in EOIR proceedings. If you want to apply for asylum, you must file your Form I-589 with EOIR. To locate where to file your Form I-589 with EOIR: Use the EOIR hotline or online system to locate an address for the immigration court where you must file your Form I-589; or Find immigration court information on the Department of Justice’s website. If you are currently in EOIR proceedings and you were asked to provide your biometric and biographical information to USCIS for your Form I-589 filed with EOIR, please refer to the Instructions for Submitting Certain Applications in Immigration Court and for Providing Biometric and Biographic Information to U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Defensive Asylum Security and Background Checks and Biometrics Scheduling FAQs section of the Immigration Benefits in EOIR Proceedings page about how to submit this information. Important: If you file your Form I-589 anywhere other than the immigration court identified by the EOIR hotline or online system, EOIR will reject your Form I-589 and send you a notice that specifies the address where you should file your Form I-589. If you do not follow these instructions and any additional instructions from DHS or EOIR, your Form I-589 may be rejected or closed or it may take longer to process your Form I-589.

L. 119-21) requires all aliens with a pending Form I-589 to pay an Annual Asylum Fee (AAF) of $100 for each calendar year that their application is pending, in addition to any other fee. The AAF is in addition to any other fee that may be due. You cannot get a waiver for the AAF. On Oct. 1, 2025, we began sending notices to all aliens with a pending Form I-589 who are required to pay the AAF. We also sent notices to any representatives of these aliens listed on Form G-28. On Oct. 30, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al., SAG-25-03299 (D. Md.), temporarily stayed the AAF implementation provisions by USCIS. USCIS strongly disagrees with the Court’s order but will follow its terms pending possible further judicial review. In accordance with the Oct. 30 order, USCIS has paused the issuance of AAF notices pending further litigation developments. Any applicant who has received a notice from USCIS instructing him or her to pay the AAF may disregard that notice while the temporary stay is in place. USCIS will not refund previously paid annual asylum fees, and applicants who paid the fee should retain their receipts. USCIS will issue updated instructions on payment of the AAF pending further litigation developments.

{"text": "Students Learn about the rules and regulations governing F and M students in the United States. Nonimmigrant students who come to the United States to study must follow specific rules. However, different rules apply depending on your student type. Student Type Learn what student type applies to you below: F-1: Nonimmigrant students enrolling in academic programs at a university, college, high school, private elementary school, seminary, conservatory or another academic institution, including an English language program. M-1: Nonimmigrant students enrolling in a technical program at vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, other than a language training program. Step One: Apply to an SEVP-Certified School Your first step is to apply to a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school in the United States. Use the School Search tool to find SEVP-certified schools and programs that are eligible to enroll F-1 and M-1 students. Step Two: Receive a Form I-20 Once you are accepted into an SEVP-certified school, your school’s designated school official will send you a document called the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status.” The Form I-20 is a record of your information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database. Each school that accepts you will send you a Form I-20. For more information, visit the Students and the Form I-20 page. Step Three: Pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee After receiving your Form I-20, you must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee before applying for your U.S. student visa. You can pay your I-901 SEVIS Fee online at FMJfee.com or by using Western Union Quick Pay . You must present the receipt as proof of payment when you apply for a visa. It’s important that the SEVIS ID number on your I-901 SEVIS Fee receipt matches your SEVIS ID number on your Form I-20.

Bring your Form I-20 and other required documents to apply for a student visa from the U.S. Department of State. A visa does not guarantee entrance to the United States; it only permits you to arrive and seek permission to enter the country. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the U.S. port of entry has the final authority to admit entry into the country.

{"text": "Home Travel For International Visitors Visa Waiver Program The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) , administered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in consultation with the State Department, permits citizens of 42 countries to travel to the United States for business or tourism for stays of up to 90 days without a visa. In return, those 42 countries must permit U.S. citizens and nationals to travel to their countries for a similar length of time without a visa for business or tourism purposes. Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) ESTA is an automated system that determines the eligibility of visitors to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Authorization via ESTA does not determine whether a traveler is admissible to the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers determine admissibility upon travelers’ arrival. The ESTA application collects biographic information and answers to VWP eligibility questions. ESTA applications may be submitted at any time prior to travel, though it is recommended that travelers apply as soon as they begin preparing travel plans or prior to purchasing airline tickets.

Office of Foreign Labor Certification Announces Delay in Publication of 2026 H-2A Monthly Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) for Herding or Production of Livestock on the Range Due to the recent lapse in appropriations, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is delaying publication of the Federal Register Notice (FRN) announcing the new monthly Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) for herding or production of livestock on the range under the H-2A program. The monthly AEWR is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) produced by the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which has not yet been published due to the funding lapse. Once the BLS releases the ECI, ETA will move promptly, consistent with Departmental procedures, to publish the FRN. November 5, 2025 - OFLC Announces Extensions and Emergency Procedures of Certain Application Processing Actions Impacted by the Government Shutdown The Department recognizes the challenges that some employers are experiencing due to the cessation of processing activities by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) in response to the lapse in appropriations. Due to the government shutdown, beginning October 1, OFLC ceased all application processing activities and suspended public access to its Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system and SeasonalJobs.dol.gov registry of H-2A and H-2B temporary job opportunities. Consequently, employers were unable to prepare and submit requests for prevailing wage determinations or labor certifications using the FLAG system or take necessary action to upload or submit responses to correspondence issued by OFLC prior to the shutdown between October 1, 2025, through October 31, 2025. In light of these unique circumstances beyond the control of employers seeking prevailing wage and labor certification determinations, OFLC is implementing the following temporary changes to its standard procedures related to applications and documents that were impacted by the cessation of application processing activities from October 1, 2025, through November 2, 2025: Submissions mailed to OFLC and postmarked between October 1 and November 2 During the time the public could not access the FLAG system, a substantial number of employers chose to submit applications and other correspondence to OFLC by mail or commercial delivery services because they were unable to file electronically. OFLC will manually enter the applications and other correspondence received from October 1, 2025, through November 2, 2025, into the FLAG system. Once the information and related correspondence associated with an application is entered into the FLAG system, a case number will be assigned in connection with an application, and employers will receive notifications to inform them that their applications have been received for processing. As soon as practicable, OFLC will also respond to correspondence submitted by e-mail or by mail or commercial delivery services once the submitted information has been entered into the FLAG system. OFLC recognizes that the delay in receiving a notification could be a cause for concern for employers. Therefore, OFLC is clarifying that any application or other correspondence submitted by mail or commercial delivery service will be considered to have been filed on the date it was postmarked. For example, a PERM application postmarked on October 1,", "metadata": {"id": "44e4e65c80739a0a", "url": "https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor", "title": "Foreign Labor Certification | U.S. Department of Labor", "agency": "WWW.DOL.GOV", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "44e4e65c80739a0a-0"}}

OFLC recognizes that the delay in receiving a notification could be a cause for concern for employers. Therefore, OFLC is clarifying that any application or other correspondence submitted by mail or commercial delivery service will be considered to have been filed on the date it was postmarked. For example, a PERM application postmarked on October 1, 2025 will be given a receipt date of October 1, 2025, upon entry into the FLAG system. Any correspondence sent by email will be deemed to have been received the day it was sent. Responses to Request for Information, Notices of Acceptance, Notices of Deficiencies, Audit Notices, Requests for Reconsideration or Review, and all other responses with an original deadline during the period of time OFLC was unable to process applications due to the government shutdown Responses or other requests for information associated with correspondence issued by OFLC related to applications that were pending on October 1, 2025, which contained a due date for response by the employer during the period of October 1, 2025, through November 2, 2025, will have their due dates automatically extended by 33 calendar days, which is the number of calendar days during which OFLC staff who were officially recalled back to work on November 3 were unable to accept and process applications. Employers do not need to submit a request to extend any submission deadline that fell during the period of October 1, 2025, through November 2, 2025. As OFLC continues to take all necessary steps to transition back to full operational status, employers are strongly encouraged to submit information and other documentation in response to correspondence issued by OFLC as soon as possible using the FLAG system. Regarding the PERM program, if an employer’s recruitment efforts or prevailing wage determination expired between October 1 and November 2, 2025, the employer impacted by these circumstances may submit applications electronically using the expired recruitment efforts or prevailing wage determination during the same 33 calendar day period during which an automatic deadline extension has been provided. Important Note : Employers may receive a warning message from the FLAG system when submitting a PERM application with recruitment that is outside the regulatory 180-day filing window or when using an expired prevailing wage determination. However, the employer will still be able to complete and submit the application. If an impacted employer believes its application was improperly denied due to expired recruitment efforts or prevailing wage determination, a request for reconsideration explaining the circumstances may be submitted to the OFLC Certifying Officer. Emergency filing procedures for H-2A, H-2B, and CW-1 applications which could not be filed between October 1, 2025, and October 31, 2025. Employers are reminded that the H-2A ( 20 CFR 655.134 (link is external) ) and H-2B ( 20 CFR 655.17 (link is external) ) regulations include provisions permitting employers to request a waiver of the regulatory time period for filing an application. The CW-1 regulations contain a provision under 20 CFR 655.422 (link is external) permitting employers to request permission to submit an application without first having obtained a prevailing wage determination. The emergency filing procedures regulations all require employers to demonstrate good and substantial cause for the requests to be accepted. OFLC recognizes that many employers were unable to timely file applications during the period of October 1, 2025, through October 31, 2025, due to the cessation of processing activities and that this circumstance was outside the control of employers. OFLC encourages employers to submit emergency requests by following the regulatory provisions for doing so for each visa program. Please note , this guidance only applies to deadlines imposed by OFLC, it does not apply to deadlines for submission of appeals to or deadlines set by the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals (BALCA). OFLC does not have the authority to change regulatory deadlines for submissions to BALCA or to alter deadlines set by BALCA.

The Department of Labor Publishes Adverse Effect Wage Rates for Non-Range Occupations in the H-2A Program; Implementation of Interim Final Rule. On October 2, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) published an interim final rule (IFR) amending its regulations regarding the methodology used to determine the Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) for non-range agricultural occupations in the H-2A visa program. The new methodology adopts the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey administered by the Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as the sole source of wage information to establish the AEWRs. This methodological change to the calculation of AEWRs more accurately represents the average wages paid to U.S. workers similarly employed by taking into account the skills and qualifications required by employers who are seeking to employ H-2A nonimmigrant workers. Additionally, the IFR addresses differences in compensation between most U.S. workers and H-2A workers who receive employer-provided housing at no cost by adopting a standard adjustment factor to account for this non-monetary compensation that applies only to the wages paid to H-2A workers employed in the job opportunity. For the vast majority of H-2A job opportunities, the Department uses the OEWS survey data to establish AEWRs applicable to five Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes combining the most common field and livestock worker occupations previously measured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Labor Survey (FLS), which covered six SOC codes. These AEWRs are divided into two skill-based categories to account for wage differentials arising from qualifications contained in the employer’s job offer. For all other occupations, the Department uses the OEWS survey to determine two skill-based AEWRs for each SOC code to reflect wage differentials. The threshold determination for assigning the SOC code(s) and applicable skill-based AEWR are based on the duties performed for the majority of the workdays during the contract period and qualifications contained in the employer’s job offer. IFR Effective Date The new AEWR methodology adopted in this IFR applies to any H-2A job orders for non-range job opportunities submitted to the NPC in connection with an Application for Temporary Employment Certification , as set forth in 20 CFR 655.121, on and after October 2, 2025, including job orders filed concurrently with an Application for Temporary Employment Certification to the NPC for emergency situations under 20 CFR 655.134. Any job orders for non-range job opportunities submitted to the OFLC National Processing Center (NPC) in connection with an Application for Temporary Employment Certification for H-2A workers before the effective date of the IFR will be processed using the 2010 H-2A Final Rule methodology, under which the AEWR for all non-range H-2A job opportunities is equal to the annual average hourly gross wage rate for field and livestock workers (combined) in the State or region as reported by FLS. Impact of Government Shutdown The Department noted its intention to post contemporaneously with the publication of this IFR a Microsoft Excel file on the OFLC Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) System enabling interested parties to locate, by State and SOC code, the AEWRs applicable for Skill Level I (Entry-Level) and Skill Level II (Experience-Level) qualifications covering all other non-range job opportunities pursuant to 20 CFR 655.120(b)(1)(ii) of this IFR. However, due to the government shutdown, the processing of foreign labor certification applications and all activities associated with implementing regulatory requirements ceased through October 31, 2025. Now that the processing of employer requests for prevailing wages and labor certification determinations for temporary and permanent employment in the United States has resumed, OFLC is able to post this announcement to implement the IFR along with all of the AEWRs applicable for Skill Level I (Entry-Level) and Skill Level II (Experience-Level) qualifications covering all other non-range job opportunities New Skill-Based AEWRs In order for employers to understand their wage obligations under this IFR, the Department is providing below a comprehensive Microsoft Excel file that includes the statewide AEWRs for Skill Level I (Entry-Level) and Skill Level II (Experience-Level) qualifications applicable to the field and livestock workers (combined) category under 20 CFR 655.120(b)(1)(i), and for every other SOC code not covered by the field and livestock workers (combined) category under 20 CFR 655.120(b)(1)(ii).

The Department of Labor Announces that the Office of Foreign Labor Certification has Resumed Application Processing The Department of Labor has resumed processing of employer requests for prevailing wages and labor certification determinations for temporary and permanent employment in the United States. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification’s (OFLC) Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system is now accessible and permits system users to prepare and submit new applications as well as submit and receive information associated with their applications pending a final determination. In addition, OFLC’s SeasonalJobs.dol.gov system, which is an online job registry of H-2A and H-2B temporary job opportunities, has been restored to full operational status. OFLC is taking all steps necessary to resume application processing and will post additional announcements and other technical assistance notices for all stakeholders on this website, as appropriate. We do anticipate increased requests for stakeholder assistance, and this means some stakeholders may experience longer than normal processing and response times. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as OFLC transitions back to full operational status. September 30, 2025. The Department of Labor Publishes Interim Final Rule Revising the Methodology Used to Determine the Adverse Effect Wage Rates for Non-Range Occupations in the H-2A Program The U.S. Department of Labor (Department) has published an interim final rule (IFR) that amends its regulations regarding the methodology used to determine the Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) for non-range agricultural occupations in the H-2A visa program. The new methodology adopts the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey administered by the Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as the sole source of wage information to establish AEWRs that better represent the average wages paid to U.S. workers similarly employed based on the skills and qualifications required by employers who are seeking to employ H-2A nonimmigrant workers.

Office of Foreign Labor Certification Announces 60-Day Public Comment Period on Proposed Revisions to H-2A Temporary Agricultural Labor Certification Program (OMB 1205-0466) On Wednesday, September 10, 2025, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) published a Federal Register notice (FRN), which proposes to revise the application forms, instructions, appendices, and other information associated with the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program as covered under OMB control number 1205-0466 (OMB 1205-0466). The proposed revisions to the information collection requirements for OMB 1205-0466 support the changes that ETA and Wage and Hour Division (WHD) proposed through its notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Recission of Final Rule: Improving Protections for Workers in Temporary Agricultural Employment in the United States (Jul. 2, 2025). Through this NPRM, ETA and WHD proposed to amend their regulations governing the certification of agricultural labor or services performed by temporary foreign workers in H-2A nonimmigrant status by substantially rescinding the H-2A provisions contained within the final rule published by the Department on April 29, 2024. ETA is proposing to continue using the forms in effect as of June 27, 2024, with the addition of “some of the assurances” approved by OMB on July 11, 2024.

Office of Foreign Labor Certification Announces Annual Determination of H-2A Labor Supply States for U.S. Worker Recruitment Pursuant to 20 CFR 655.154(d), the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) Administrator announces the annual determination of labor supply states (LSS). LSS are additional states in which an employer’s job order will be circulated and, if appropriate, where additional recruitment may be required. On May 22, 2025, consistent with 20 CFR 655.154, the OFLC Administrator solicited public input for 60 days about LSS and related recruitment mechanisms to make a determination that identifies whether there are areas of traditional or expected labor supply for each state with respect to the availability of qualified workers and the appropriate and effective means of recruiting those workers. This determination includes specific geographic area(s) of the United States in which a significant number of qualified workers have been identified and who, if recruited through additional positive employer recruitment activities, would be willing to make themselves available for work in the state. The LSS determination is effective as of the date of this announcement for employers who have not commenced recruitment after receiving a Notice of Acceptance. This determination will remain valid until the OFLC Administrator publishes a new determination on the OFLC website as provided by 20 CFR 655.154(d). After consideration of the information received, the OFLC Administrator has determined that all current LSS requirements will remain in full effect, with the following modifications: Minnesota: OFLC is adding Texas to Minnesota’s Labor Supply Matrix to begin inter-state recruitment of job orders that originate in Texas. Mississippi: OFLC will remove the additional positive recruitment requirement for newspaper advertisement in the Delta region. Updated labor supply state information is available on OFLC's labor supply State page on the Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG).

View the Federal Register notice (link is external) In rescinding the July 2011 FAQ, OFLC recognizes that employers, particularly those in the specialty crop sector, may have challenges accurately predicting their labor needs because the timing of their diversified agricultural work is highly sensitive to unpredictable weather conditions, and the H-2A regulations require employers to start the labor certification process at least two months in advance of the season. As a result of these circumstances, some employers need additional flexibility in the H-2A process to employ workers onto their farming operations starting at different times within the season. To better reflect its seasonal labor needs and without any undue burden, an employer can use existing fields on the job order (Form ETA-790A) to disclose the total number of H-2A worker positions being requested for temporary labor certification and period of intended employment and, for any job duties related to specific crops or agricultural activities, identify other subsequent date(s) of need using Field A.8.a on the job order to more accurately represent their seasonal labor demands, so prospective U.S. applicants are better informed and have a fair opportunity to fill these jobs.

Updates to the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics Wage Estimates for the State of Colorado for the July 2025 through June 2026 Wage Year The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) has updated the latest prevailing wage data from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey generated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the State of Colorado. The updated wage estimates for all locations in Colorado will be used by OFLC from July 31, 2025, through the end of the current wage year on June 30, 2026. On July 1, 2025, OFLC began using updated OEWS wage estimates for the wage year from July 2025 through June 2026.

OFLC had planned to use national wage estimates for all locations in Colorado beginning on July 1, 2025; however, to avoid the potential confusion of using national wage estimates for only a couple of weeks, OFLC decided to pause processing for the small number of prevailing wage requests in Colorado which would have otherwise been processed in July using OEWS wages. BLS informed OFLC that updated OEWS wage data would be available in July 2025. OFLC has resumed and is prioritizing the processing of the paused Colorado prevailing wage requests has resumed now that Colorado-specific wage data is available.

Department of Labor Announces Temporary Suspension of H-2A Certification Fees for H-2A Employers; Establishment of Electronic-Based Fee Collection System The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has published a new Federal Register notice informing its stakeholders that the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) will be suspending the collection of H-2A certification fees, effective September 2, 2025. Employers who receive an invoice from OFLC must still pay all required H-2A certification fees. OFLC will cease submitting invoices to H-2A employers as of September 2, 2025, upon suspending the collection of H-2A certification fees. Furthermore, OFLC will not request reimbursement of any H-2A certification fees that would have come due during the suspension period. During the suspension period, OFLC will be modernizing its payment process, consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 14247, Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account , by transitioning to an electronic payment system for the collection of H-2A certification fees. Upon implementation of the new payment system, ETA will issue a second FRN informing stakeholders about the new electronic process for the submission of fees as well as the effective date for OFLC resuming the collection of H-2A certification fees, consistent with 20 CFR 655.163.

The actual process for permanent labor certification varies depending upon the program being used. This Web site contains information regarding the process for filing for each of the programs under the Department of Labor's (DOL) jurisdiction. The filing of applications is the responsibility of the employer, not the employee. However, the employee can benefit from understanding the program being utilized in his/her behalf. In general, the DOL works to ensure that the admission of foreign workers to work in the U.S. will not adversely affect the job opportunities, wages and working conditions of U.S. workers. Once a permanent labor certification application has been approved by the DOL, the employer will need to seek the immigration authorization from USCIS. Program Overview A permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States. In most instances, before the U.S. employer can submit an immigration petition to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (link is external) , the employer must obtain a certified labor certification application from the DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). The DOL must certify to the USCIS that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. To improve the operations of the permanent labor certification program (PERM), ETA published a final regulation on December 27, 2004, implementing a new, re-engineered permanent labor certification program, effective March 28, 2005. This new electronic program has improved services to our various stakeholders. As of March 28, 2005, ETA Form 750 applications were no longer accepted under the regulation in effect prior to March 28, 2005, and instead new Form ETA 9089 applications had to be filed under the new PERM regulation at the appropriate National Processing Center (NPC). Applications filed under the regulation in effect prior to March 28, 2005, continued to be processed under the rule in effect at the time of filing at an appropriate Backlog Elimination Center until such time as the backlog was eliminated. Where an employer chose to withdraw an application filed under the regulation in effect prior to March 28, 2005, and still in process, and to refile an application for the identical job opportunity under the refile provisions of the PERM regulation, the employer was permitted to use the previously filed ETA Form 750 application filing date. DOL processes Applications for Permanent Employment Certification, Form ETA 9089, with the exception of Schedule A and sheepherder applications filed under 20 CFR § 656.16. The date the labor certification application is received by the DOL is known as the filing date and is used by USCIS and the Department of State as the priority date. After the labor certification application is certified by DOL, it should be submitted to the appropriate USCIS Service Center with a Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. The certification has a validity period of 180-days and expires if not submitted to USCIS within this period.

As part of the U.S. Department of Labor's commitment to supporting the goals of an open and transparent government, this page provides easy access to employment-based immigration data organized in three main categories: Selected statistics providing cumulative quarterly data by major immigration program; Cumulative quarterly and fiscal year releases of program disclosure data; and Historical fiscal year annual program and performance report information. Expand All Collapse All Disclosure Data Disclosure data consists of selected information extracted from nonimmigrant and immigrant application tables within the Office of Foreign Labor Certification's case management systems. The data sets provide public access to the latest quarterly and annual data in easily accessible formats for the purpose of performing in-depth longitudinal research and analysis. Each data set is cumulative for the fiscal year, containing unique records identified by the applicable OFLC case number based on the most recent date a case determination decision was issued. Information that appears in these records is provided by employers and system-generated metadata, such as received dates and decision dates. Any typographical errors or other data anomalies (e.g., incomplete or blank data fields, etc.) may be due to internal data entry or other external customer errors in completing and submitting the applications for processing. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2020, the Program Record Layouts associated with each program disclosure file are substantially different from prior fiscal years and include a number of additional data fields extracted based on new visa application forms, appendices, and addenda implemented by OFLC through the new Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) System . In some instances, case information may not be included in the program disclosure data for the following reasons: If it involves the status of a case that is currently being processed and for which a final determination has not yet been made; If it contains information deemed to be Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (e.g., Federal Employer Identification Numbers (FEIN), attorney state bar numbers, and foreign worker names, addresses, etc.); and If the data collection item on the application form is an open text field with a very large character limit making it difficult to extract into a user-friendly format (e.g., job duties, statement of temporary need, etc.). The data sets are available in the Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) file format and organized by the federal fiscal year (October 1 through September 30). Please refer to the Program Record Layout documents provided for each dataset, which lists each field title and respective field description. Important Notice: Employer-specific case information that appears on this website was provided to OFLC by employers who submitted prevailing wage, labor certification and labor attestation applications for processing. These are not employer responses to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Statistics (BLS-OES) survey. The BLS-OES program provides OFLC with aggregate wage estimates, by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) and geographic area, which are used in establishing prevailing wages based on the employer's job opportunity and requirements. However, the BLS does not provide OFLC with the wage rates reported for any individual businesses. The identity of respondents and the information that they report to BLS under the OES program is kept in strict confidence in accordance with BLS Data Integrity Guidelines and with the Confidentiality Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA) of 2002. Latest Quarterly Updates The following case disclosure files cover determinations issued between October 1, 2024 and June 30, 2025. A small percentage of determinations may be subject to change in subsequent quarterly releases due to appeal or redetermination decisions on employer applications. Please note: The LCA (H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) and H-2A programs contain some cases from the iCERT database, prior to FLAG system implementation.

Consequently, two FY 2009 H-1B data disclosure files were published-the \"H-1B Case Data FY2009\" file for applications processed through the iCERT System beginning on April 15, 2009, and the \"H-1B Efile Case Data FY2009\" file for applications processed through the H-1B legacy system. (2) Disclosure data includes prevailing wage determinations issued from the OFLC iCERT System between January 20 and September 30, 2010, when employers began electronic filing of requests for prevailing wage determinations. Prior to January 1, 2010, all prevailing wage determinations were received and processed by State Workforce Agencies and no national-level electronic record data are available prior to this data.

To comply with the statute, the Department's regulations require that the wages offered to a foreign worker must be the prevailing wage rate for the occupational classification in the area of employment. The prevailing wage rate is defined as the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a specific occupation in the area of intended employment. Effective January 4, 2010, employers can obtain this wage rate by submitting a request to the National Prevailing Wage Center (NPWC), or by accessing other legitimate sources of information such as the OFLC Wage Search , available for use in some programs. The requirement to pay prevailing wages as a minimum is true of most employment-based visa programs involving the Department of Labor. In addition, the H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 programs require the employer to pay the prevailing wage or the actual wage paid by the employer to workers with similar skills and qualifications, whichever is higher. The Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has provided wage data collected under the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program for use in the Foreign Labor Certification process since 1998. The wage data is available on the Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) website at https://flag.dol.gov/wage-data/wage-search Since September 1999, the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) has been used by the OEWS program to classify occupational wage information. The SOC provides a common language for categorizing occupations. It also serves as the framework for information being gathered through the Department of Labor's Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The O*NET provides the general public information on skills, abilities, knowledge, tasks, work activities, and the specific vocational preparation levels associated with occupations. Wage data from the OEWS survey and occupational information in O*NET are both classified by the SOC, reducing the need to use crosswalks to connect wages to occupational requirements. The prevailing wage information provided in this section pertains to the Nonagricultural Immigration Programs (PERM, H-2B, H-1B, H-1B1, H-1C and E-3). Please see below for the Agricultural Immigration Program (H-2A) prevailing wage resources or click here to visit the H-2A program page. Guidance The NPWC uses the Prevailing Wage Determination Policy Guidance in issuing wage determinations for the Nonagricultural Immigration Programs. The Department updated the guidance in November 2009 following the publication of the H-2B regulation and the corresponding changes to PERM, H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 regulations that affected the prevailing wage determination process. To read the updated Prevailing Wage guidance, please click here Filing Process To request a prevailing wage determination (PWD) for a Nonagricultural Immigration Program (PERM, H-1B, H-1B1, H-2B, and E-3) employers must complete Form ETA-9141 and submit it to the National Prevailing Wage Center. Electronic filing using the FLAG System is strongly recommended. For the H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 programs, employers have the option of using one of three wage sources to obtain the prevailing wage: (1) a PWD obtained from the NPWC; (2) a survey conducted by an independent authoritative source; or (3) another legitimate source of wage information. By obtaining a PWD from the NPWC, H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 employers are given \"safe-harbor status,\" meaning that if the employer's wage compliance is investigated for any reason, the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor will not challenge the validity of the prevailing wage as long as it was applied properly (i.e., correct geographic area, occupation, and skill level). To request a prevailing wage determination (PWD) for the non-immigrant program for workers in Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), CW-1, employers must complete Form ETA-9141C and submit it to the National Prevailing Wage Center.

Additional Documentation May Be Required Review the instructions on how to apply for a visa on the website of the embassy or consulate where you will apply. Additional documents may be requested to establish if you are qualified. Most visa applicants, except H-1B and L, need to show their intent to return to their home country after their temporary stay in the United States. They can do so by showing proof of compelling ties to the home country, which may include: A residence abroad which you do not intend to abandon Your family relationships Your economic situation Your long term plans Attend your Visa Interview During the visa interview, a consular officer will determine if you are eligible for the visa.

Review the visa processing time , to learn how soon your passport with visa will generally be ready for pick-up or delivery by the courier. Entering the United States A visa allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport). A visa also allows you to request permission to enter the United States. A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States. When admitted, you may get an admission stamp or Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record. Review the CBP website to learn more about entry requirements and customs restrictions. Extending Your Stay You must leave the United States on or before the date indicated on your admission stamp or Form I-94. You can request to extend your stay by contacting USCIS. Visit USCIS's Extend Your Stay website for more information. Failure to leave the United States on time will result in you being out of status . Under U.S. law, visas of travelers who are out of status are automatically voided ( Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ). If you had a multiple-entry visa and it was voided due to you being out of status, it will not be valid for future entries into the United States. Failure to leave the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas you may apply for in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more. Change of Status While in the United States, you may be able to request a change to another nonimmigrant category. See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more. Requesting a change of status does not require that you apply for a new visa, as long as you remain in status. If you cannot remain in status while USCIS processes your change of status request, you must apply for a visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. Additional Information The approval of a petition does not guarantee that you will get a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.

You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States. Visa Denial and Ineligibility Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials and waivers. Visa Renewal The same visa application process applies for first-time applicants and renewals. Please review How to Apply for more information. Some applicants may be eligible for interview waiver. Interview waiver allows eligible individuals to renew their visa without an in-person interview. To determine if you are eligible for interview waiver, please review the instructions on the website of the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you will apply. I was refused a visa under section 214(b). May I reapply? Yes, if you feel circumstances have changed regarding your application. Review Visa Denials to learn more.

If you plan to apply for a nonimmigrant visa to come to the United States as a temporary visitor, please review the current wait time for an interview using the Global Visa Wait Times table linked below. Global Visa Wait Times Wait Time for Interview The estimated wait time to receive a nonimmigrant visa interview appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate and is based on workload and staffing and can vary from week to week. The information provided is an estimate and does not guarantee the availability of an appointment. Wait Time for Interview Waiver Wait times for applicants eligible for Interview Waiver are applicable only for locations where applicants schedule appointments to submit their passport and any required documents to a U.S. embassy or consulate. The wait time estimate does not account for the time required for a consular officer to adjudicate the application nor mailing time of passports or other documents. Refer to the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will apply to determine your eligibility for Interview Waiver and for instructions for submitting a nonimmigrant visa application. Note that applicants must be a national or resident of the country where they are applying to be eligible to apply via Interview Waiver. Qualifications for an Expedited Interview Appointment Consular sections overseas may be able to expedite your interview date if there is an urgent, unforeseen situation such as a funeral, medical emergency, or school start date. The process to request an expedited nonimmigrant visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment. In all cases : You must first submit the online visa application form (DS-160), pay the application fee, and schedule the first available interview appointment. Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment. Note: Travel for the purpose of attending weddings and graduation ceremonies, assisting pregnant relatives, participating in an annual business/academic/professional conference, or enjoying last-minute tourism does not qualify for expedited appointments. For such travel, please schedule a regular visa appointment well in advance. Administrative Processing These estimates do not include time required for administrative processing, which may affect some applications. When administrative processing is required, the timing will vary based on individual circumstances of each case. Administrative Processing Information There are only two possible outcomes for U.S. visa applications. The consular officer will either issue or refuse the visa. If a visa applicant has not established that he or she is eligible for a visa, the consular officer must refuse that application. However, some refused visa applications may require further administrative processing. When administrative processing is required, the consular officer will inform the applicant at the end of the interview. The duration of the administrative processing will vary based on the individual circumstances of each case. At the conclusion of the administrative processing period, the consular officer might conclude that an applicant is now qualified for the visa for which he or she applied. The officer may also conclude that the applicant remains ineligible for a visa. Visa applicants are reminded to apply early for their visas, well in advance of the anticipated travel date. Important Notice: Except in cases of emergency travel (i.e. serious illnesses, injuries, or deaths in your immediate family), before making inquiries about status of administrative processing, applicants should wait at least 180 days from the date of interview or submission of supplemental documents, whichever is later. About Visa Processing Wait Times – Nonimmigrant Visa Applicants Information about nonimmigrant visa wait times for interviews and visa processing time frames are shown on this website, as well as on U.S. Embassy and Consulate websites worldwide.

{"text": "Policy Manual Print Manual Table of Contents The USCIS Policy Manual is the agency’s centralized online repository for USCIS’ immigration policies. The USCIS Policy Manual will ultimately replace the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM), the USCIS Immigration Policy Memoranda site, and other policy repositories. Close All Open All About the Policy Manual The USCIS Policy Manual is the agency’s centralized online repository for USCIS’ immigration policies. The Policy Manual is replacing the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM), the USCIS Immigration Policy Memoranda site, and other USCIS policy repositories. The Policy Manual contains separate volumes pertaining to different areas of immigration benefits administered by the agency, such as citizenship and naturalization, adjustment of status, and nonimmigrants. The content is organized into different volumes, parts, and chapters. The Policy Manual provides transparency of immigration policies and furthers consistency, quality, and efficiency consistent with the USCIS mission. The Policy Manual provides all the latest policy updates; an expanded table of contents; keyword search function; and links to the Immigration and Nationality Act and Code of Federal Regulations, as well as public use forms. The Policy Manual contains tables and charts to facilitate understanding of complex topics. The Policy Manual also contains all historical policy updates. The Policy Manual contains the official policies of USCIS and assists immigration officers in rendering decisions. The Policy Manual is to be followed by all USCIS officers in the performance of their duties but it does not remove their discretion in making adjudicatory decisions. The Policy Manual does not create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person. How to use the USCIS Policy Manual website Adjudicator's Field Manual Transition USCIS is retiring its Adjudicator's Field Manual (AFM), a collection of our immigration policies and procedures. We are working to update and incorporate all AFM content into the USCIS Policy Manual. Until then, we have moved any remaining AFM content in PDF format to its corresponding Policy Manual Part. To the extent that a provision in the Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda , the updated information in the Policy Manual prevails. If you have questions or concerns about any discrepancies among these resources, contact PolicyFeedback@uscis.dhs.gov To find remaining AFM content, see the crosswalk (PDF, 304.67 KB) between the AFM and the Policy Manual.

USCIS automatically issues an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to principal petitioners upon the approval of the U nonimmigrant status petition. [1] The statute only allows 10,000 U nonimmigrant visas to be issued every fiscal year. [2] If the number of approvable petitions exceeds 10,000, USCIS places the approvable petitions on a waiting list. Once they are on the waiting list, USCIS grants deferred action or, in limited circumstances, parole to U-1 principal petitioners and qualifying family members and, as a matter of discretion, may authorize employment for such petitioners and qualifying family members. [3] USCIS generally provides such employment authorization under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14) . Under the existing regulatory structure, aliens with pending petitions are currently unable to apply for employment authorization before waiting list placement. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA 2008), signed into law on December 23, 2008, amended Section 214(p)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to provide DHS with discretion to grant employment authorization to an alien who has a pending, bona fide petition for U nonimmigrant status. [4] Though permitted by statute, DHS had not previously implemented a process for providing such employment authorization, separate from the existing regulatory waiting list, before June 14, 2021. The permissive language of INA 214(p)(6) does not require the agency to create a separate employment authorization process. However, because of drastic increases in the volume of U nonimmigrant petitions and a growing backlog, USCIS decided to exercise its discretion to conduct bona fide determinations (BFD) and provide EADs and deferred action to aliens with pending, bona fide petitions who meet certain discretionary standards, beginning on June 14, 2021. INA 103(a) grants the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to enforce the immigration laws and provides general authority for deferred action. The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that decisions made to either initiate or terminate enforcement proceedings are under the purview of the Executive Branch, [5] and therefore fall within DHS’s authority. The Executive Branch has exercised its discretion to grant deferred action, and the federal courts have consistently recognized the existence of this authority, since the mid-1970s. [6] While USCIS has approved the statutory maximum of petitions each year since Fiscal Year 2010, the increasing number of petitions and complexity of the adjudication resulted in increased processing times. USCIS attempted to keep up with this increase by shifting resources as well as hiring and training new officers; yet, despite these attempts, the burden quickly outpaced resources given competing demands and priorities across the agency. Consequently, the number of remaining pending petitions after the annual cap was reached grew dramatically. Though the waiting list was initially conceived to address the gap between petitions filed and available visas, USCIS’ ability to adjudicate pending petitions for placement on the waiting list has been and continues to be outmatched by the steady number of new filings. To illustrate, in 2009, USCIS received 6,850 principal petitions; in 2020, 22,358 principal petitions were filed. From 2015-2018, over 30,000 principal petitions were filed annually. [7] The pending backlog, and the corresponding delay in adjudication time, is due to the increase in U visa filings overall, the complexity of the adjudication, the statutory cap mandated by Congress, and the agency’s priorities and limited resources. As of June 14, 2021, USCIS is unable to adjudicate the tens of thousands of petitions for the waiting list, as well as completing full adjudication for the 10,000 principal visas available under the statutory cap, in a single fiscal year without incurring a negative impact in other humanitarian programs and fee-based applications or petitions. Taking into consideration the overall filings increase and the numerous adjudications USCIS is responsible for, USCIS must allocate resources among the competing adjudicative priorities and balance the number of resources that can be assigned to the U visa program. Additionally, as of June 14, 2021, USCIS is facing substantial litigation fueled by the years-long wait times for petitioners to be placed on the waiting list and obtain U nonimmigrant status due to the number of new petitions filed each year exceeding the statutory cap. Case review has revealed that most U nonimmigrant petitioners do not have lawful immigration status and are not otherwise authorized to work, so they may be vulnerable during the lengthy adjudication period. USCIS recognizes concerns regarding such vulnerability raised by stakeholders and believes implementing the statute’s authorization to provide EADs to those with pending, bona fide petitions better aligns the U program with its dual purpose as envisioned by Congress: stabilizing victims of crime and serving as a tool for law enforcement. [8] In addition, the BFD process enables USCIS to review petitions more efficiently, and provide the benefits of employment authorization and deferred action to more petitioners in a shorter", "metadata": {"id": "bcba71233c73d5e7", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-3", "title": "Volume 3 - Humanitarian Protection and Parole | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "bcba71233c73d5e7-1"}}

USCIS recognizes concerns regarding such vulnerability raised by stakeholders and believes implementing the statute’s authorization to provide EADs to those with pending, bona fide petitions better aligns the U program with its dual purpose as envisioned by Congress: stabilizing victims of crime and serving as a tool for law enforcement. [8] In addition, the BFD process enables USCIS to review petitions more efficiently, and provide the benefits of employment authorization and deferred action to more petitioners in a shorter time period than the waiting list process alone, which requires a full adjudicative review of eligibility for nonimmigrant status. USCIS notes that from FY 2009 through FY 2020, over 75 percent of fully adjudicated Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status ( Form I-918 ) have been approved. [9] Therefore, under this policy, USCIS deems a petition “bona fide” when USCIS determines that the Form I-918 is complete and properly filed [10] and has received the result of the petitioner’s biometrics. Because INA 214(p)(6) gives the Secretary of Homeland Security, and USCIS as the Secretary's designee, discretion to issue employment authorization to pending, bona fide principal petitioners and qualifying family members, USCIS also considers whether the principal petitioners or qualifying family members appear to pose a risk to national security [11] or public safety, and otherwise merit a favorable exercise of discretion. The EAD and deferred action that USCIS issues for these cases is valid for 4 years, subject to termination if USCIS determines a national security or public safety concern has arisen, or a determination that the BFD EAD is no longer warranted, or that the prior BFD EAD and deferred action was issued in error. USCIS issues BFD EADs under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14) because recipients of BFD EADs also receive deferred action. Furthermore, there is currently no other EAD category specifically designated for principal petitioners and qualifying family members with pending, bona fide petitions. INA 214(p)(6) provides the statutory foundation for the implementation of the BFD process, and explicitly speaks to the granting of employment authorization. As such, petitioners granted BFD EADs receive employment authorization documents under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14) B. Administrative Procedure Act Considerations The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) excepts interpretive rules; general statements of policy; and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice and comment requirements. [12] On June 14, 2021, USCIS updated the Policy Manual to notify the public of its interpretation of “bona fide application” at INA 214(p)(6) , its exercise of discretion under that provision, and explain its policy for issuing such EADs and granting deferred action. USCIS’ interpretation is reasonable because “bona fide” generally means “made in good faith; without fraud or deceit.” [13] In this context, USCIS interprets the bona fide standard [14] as being met once the entire petition (including the required certification on Form I-918, Supplement B ) is properly filed and biometrics are submitted and received. The completion of the Supplement B by a law enforcement official or judge provides an appropriate assurance of the bona fide nature of the petition in this context. Likewise, because INA 214(p)(6) gives USCIS discretionary authority to issue such employment authorization, it is reasonable, in the exercise of such discretion, to assess security checks to determine whether petitioners may pose a threat to national security or public safety before according benefits under this section. The Policy Manual guidance explains and provides clarification to officers but does not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights or obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS evaluates applications for immigration benefit requests. 1. Unfair Surprise and Reliance Interests An agency changing its interpretation of a regulation should consider, among other factors, whether the interpretative change creates unfair surprise. [15] USCIS is issuing this guidance to clarify what the law and regulations permit or require. USCIS is not restricting the program for pending petitioners; rather, USCIS is using its statutory authority to provide an additional pathway to employment authorization and deferred action. Pending petitioners will not be treated in a disparate or unfair manner, as the evaluation for an EAD is based on the initial evidence petitioners must submit when filing a Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status ( Form I-918 This process does not create an undue burden on pending or future petitioners, as it does not change any evidentiary requirement. Rather, it utilizes the filing system already in place to issue benefits to Form I-918 petitioners and mitigate any vulnerabilities they may face due to the lengthy adjudicatory wait times.

Rather, it utilizes the filing system already in place to issue benefits to Form I-918 petitioners and mitigate any vulnerabilities they may face due to the lengthy adjudicatory wait times. Additionally, those who are not granted BFD EADs and deferred action under the first phase of review proceed to the full waiting list adjudication, thereby receiving the same adjudicative review they would have had before this policy implementation. Consequently, the new policy only has an adverse impact on overseas derivatives where the principal petitioner resides in the U.S. USCIS notes that overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members would not benefit from this EAD and deferred action process because they are not physically located in the United States. Neither deferred action nor employment authorization are accorded to aliens or qualifying family members outside the United States. USCIS considered the potential impact to such petitioners and determined that offering employment authorization and deferred action to the majority of petitioners (as a majority of Form I-918 petitioners are physically located in the United States), coupled with the statutory authority to provide employment to pending, bona fide petitioners, provides numerous benefits. Additionally, USCIS does not anticipate that overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members would be harmed by this process, since the agency continues to conduct full waiting list adjudications for overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members, as the agency has previously done. Consequently, this policy has no adverse impact upon overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members. USCIS notes that there will be adverse impacts to overseas qualifying family members where the principal petitioner is in the United States; if the principal petitioner receives the BFD EAD and deferred action, there is not a sufficient basis to conduct a waiting list adjudication for the qualifying family member. However, USCIS believes the overall benefits of this policy change outweigh the adverse impacts. The BFD process only provides a basic review of the principal petition for U nonimmigrant status, and does not require the petitioner to establish eligibility for U nonimmigrant status but for visa availability in a given fiscal year under the statutory cap. USCIS cannot provide different levels of adjudication to a principal petitioner and the petitioner's qualifying family members. Advancing qualifying family members to an adjudicative phase beyond that of the principal petitioner would conflict with the INA’s requirement that the qualifying family members be “accompanying or following to join” the principal petitioner, and in addition would be confusing and difficult to administer. [16] USCIS also considered providing petitioners in the United States who have overseas beneficiaries the option of forgoing the BFD process for a waiting list adjudication; however, this would create multiple adjudicatory tracks and result in operational inefficiencies that this policy change was meant to eliminate. USCIS recognizes that 8 CFR 214.14(d)(2) states, “After U-1 nonimmigrant status has been issued to qualifying petitioners on the waiting list, any remaining U-1 nonimmigrant numbers for that fiscal year will be issued to new qualifying petitioners in the order that the petitions were properly filed.” Historically, USCIS has interpreted and applied this provision to mean that it will grant visas to those on the waiting list, based on the date the petition was filed, before granting visas to those not on the waiting list. Yet the regulation also clearly states “the oldest petitions receiving the highest priority” for such cap numbers. Under this policy, as part of the first phase of review, USCIS issues EADs and deferred action to aliens in the United States with a bona fide petition, instead of placing them in the queue for a waiting list adjudication. Those who do not receive an EAD under the first phase proceed to the full waiting list adjudication. That is, if their petitions are approvable, they are placed on the waiting list to receive an EAD and deferred action. As these two tracks receive the same benefits (EAD and deferred action), the most equitable path is to continue to issue visas based on the date a petition is filed, regardless of whether a petitioner is placed on the waiting list or not. USCIS believes this approach best implements the regulatory provision and statute, and provides the greatest benefit to all petitioners, without adversely impacting any petitioner.

USCIS believes this approach best implements the regulatory provision and statute, and provides the greatest benefit to all petitioners, without adversely impacting any petitioner. USCIS considered the alternative of continuing to adjudicate petitions on the waiting list first, before those with BFD EADs, but believes that would be inequitable and in conflict with the regulatory language directing that the oldest petitions receive the highest priority. Most of those with BFD EADs will never be placed on the waiting list. To make them wait behind all petitioners on the current waiting list regardless of filing date, and to prioritize those placed on the waiting list in the future, would effectively penalize those who were able to receive BFD EADs because they had properly filed a complete Form I-918 that did not raise any public safety or national security risks. Accordingly, USCIS will adjudicate petitions for U nonimmigrant status in date-filed order, drawing from both BFD EAD recipients and petitioners on the waiting list. 2. Criminal History Check for Bona Fide Determination Employment Authorization Documents Before June 14, 2021, USCIS officers considered criminal history background checks when adjudicating a Form I-918 petition: first, for waiting list placement and second, for the final adjudication when a visa has become available. USCIS continues to evaluate whether a principal petitioner or a qualifying family member may maintain a BFD EAD and grant of deferred action throughout the 4-year validity period until final adjudication for U nonimmigrant status; however, as of June 14, 2021, USCIS will review and update background and security checks at regular intervals during the validity period of a principal petitioner or qualifying family member’s BFD EAD and deferred action. USCIS also retains discretion to update background and security checks at any time when case-specific circumstances warrant. By reviewing updated background and security checks at regular intervals during the validity period, USCIS will ensure the petitioner continues to pose no risk to public safety and national security. USCIS does not believe this review would adversely impact any petitioner’s reliance interests or raise retroactivity concerns, as the checks are already run regularly. Additionally, implementing these checks allows USCIS to maintain a balance between providing employment authorization to eligible immigrant victims of crime and ensuring the security of the United States. Finally, any public safety and national security issues raised anew after a BFD EAD and deferred action have been granted will be fully evaluated during the waiting list adjudication, under the same adjudicative review as would have occurred before this policy implementation. C. Implementation USCIS began implementing this policy on June 14, 2021. This policy applies to all Form I-918 petitions pending on June 14, 2021, as well as Form I-918 petitions filed on or after that date. The guidance contained in the Policy Manual is controlling and supersedes any related prior guidance. Footnotes [^ 1] See 8 CFR 214.14(c)(7) .

One of the main purposes for issuing employment authorization to those with pending, bona fide petitions is to provide EADs to good faith petitioners who are vulnerable due to lengthy wait times. Requiring and adjudicating the Form I-192 for purposes of the EAD would delay the EAD adjudication and undermine the efficiency goals of this change. Instead of adjudicating the Form I-192 at this stage, USCIS relies on criminal history checks. [^ 11] See INA 212(a)(3) [^ 12] See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) [^ 13] See Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). [^ 14] USCIS considered different potential definitions of “bona fide” and ultimately determined that this definition was best suited to this context. USCIS specifically considered the criteria for the “bona fide determination” at 8 CFR 214.11(e), regarding alien victims of severe forms of trafficking, but ultimately decided not to adopt those criteria because of the differences between the U and T visa requirements, such as the law enforcement certification requirement for U nonimmigrant petitioners. See INA 214(p)(1) 8 CFR 214.14(c)(2)(i) . The completion of the Supplement B by a law enforcement official or judge provides an appropriate assurance of the bona fide nature of the petition in this context. Additionally, the T regulation requires consideration of waivers of inadmissibility, for which an RFE is often required. This would significantly delay the U BFD adjudication, contrary to Congress’ likely intent in authorizing the issuance of this interim benefit. It would also undermine the procedural efficiencies this policy was intended to create in comparison with the waiting list process. [^ 15] See Long Island Care at Home Ltd. v.

{"text": "centers, see Chapter 4, Regional Center Applications [ 6 USCIS-PM G.4 ], Chapter 5, Project Applications [ 6 USCIS-PM G.5 ], and Chapter 6, Direct and Third Party Promoters [ 6 USCIS-PM G.6 The goal of the Regional Center Program is to stimulate economic growth in a specified geographic area. The regional center model can offer an immigrant investor already defined investment opportunities, thereby reducing the immigrant investor’s responsibility to identify acceptable investment vehicles. If the new commercial enterprise is located within the geographic area, and falls within the economic scope of the defined regional center, reasonable methodologies can be used to demonstrate indirect job creation. [1] A regional center can be associated with one or more new commercial enterprises. A regional center seeking to participate in the Regional Center Program must submit a proposal using the Application For Regional Center Under the Immigrant Investor Program (Form I-924). USCIS may designate a regional center based on a general proposal for the promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment. The statute further provides that a regional center shall have jurisdiction over a limited geographic area, which shall be described in the proposal and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. In addition, the establishment of a regional center may be based on general predictions, contained in the proposal, concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive capital from immigrant investors, the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such capital investments, and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have on the area. [2] The regulations state that the proposal must: Clearly describe how the regional center focuses on a geographical region of the United States and how it will promote economic growth through increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment; Provide in verifiable detail how jobs will be created directly or indirectly; Provide a detailed statement regarding the amounts and sources of capital which have been already committed to the regional center; Provide a description of the promotional efforts taken and planned by the sponsors of the regional center; Include a detailed prediction [3] how the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy based on factors such as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and without the regional center; and Be supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools, including, but not limited to, feasibility studies, analyses of foreign and domestic markets for the goods or services to be exported, or multiplier tables. [4] The level of verifiable detail required for a Form I-924 to be approved and provided deference may vary depending on the nature of the application filing. [5] A. Regional Center Application Proposals The regional center proposal must include a management and operational plan to administer, oversee, and manage the proposed regional center, including but not limited to how the regional center: Will be promoted to attract immigrant investors, including a description of the budget for promotional activities; Will identify, assess, and evaluate proposed immigrant investor projects and enterprises; Characterizes the structure of the investment capital it will sponsor; for example, whether the investment capital to be sought for job-creating companies will consist solely of immigrant investor capital or a combination of immigrant investor capital and domestic capital, and how the distribution of the investment capital will be structured (for example, loans to developers or venture capital); and Will oversee all investment activities affiliated with, through, or under the sponsorship of the proposed regional center. Geographic Area An officer reviews the proposed geographic boundaries of a new regional center to determine if they are acceptable. USCIS considers geographic boundaries acceptable if the regional center applicant can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed area. [6] The determination is fact-specific, and the law does not require any particular form of evidence, such as a county-by-county analysis. In addition, a regional center’s geographic area must be limited, contiguous, and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. [7] To demonstrate that the proposed geographic area is limited, the regional center applicant should submit evidence demonstrating the linkages between proposed economic activities within the proposed area based on different variables. Examples of variables to demonstrate linkages between economic activities can include but are not limited to: Regional connectivity; The labor pool and supply chain; and Interdependence between projects. Moreover, in assessing the likelihood that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed geographic area, an officer reviews the impact of the activity relative to relevant", "metadata": {"id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6", "title": "Volume 6 - Immigrants | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff-2"}}

Moreover, in assessing the likelihood that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed geographic area, an officer reviews the impact of the activity relative to relevant economic conditions. The size of the proposed area should be limited and consistent with the scope and scale of the proposed economic activity, as the regional center applicant is required to focus on a geographical region of the United States. [8] The regional center applicant must present an economic analysis of its proposed economic activity in the proposed geographic area that is supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools. [9] The Form I-924 instructions provide further information regarding the requirements of the economic analysis. B. Types of Regional Center Projects An actual project refers to a specific project proposal that is supported by a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant business plan. [10] A hypothetical project refers to a project proposal that is not supported by a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant business plan. The term exemplar refers to a sample Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor (Form I-526), filed with Form I-924 for an actual project. This type of regional center proposal contains copies of the commercial enterprise’s organizational and transactional documents, which USCIS reviews to determine if they are in compliance with established eligibility requirements. 1. Hypothetical Projects If the Form I-924 projects are hypothetical projects, general proposals and general predictions may be sufficient to determine that the proposed regional center will more likely than not promote economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. A regional center applicant seeking review of a hypothetical project should clarify in the Form I-924 submission that the project is hypothetical. General proposals and predictions may include a description of the project parameters, such as: Proposed project activities, industries, locations, and timelines; A general market analysis of the proposed job creating activities and explanation regarding how the proposed project activities are likely to promote economic growth and create jobs; and A description, along with supporting evidence, of the regional center principals’ relevant experience and expertise. While hypothetical project submissions are sufficient for regional center designation, previous determinations based on hypothetical projects will not receive deference. Actual projects will receive a de novo officer review during subsequent filings (for example, through the adjudication of an amended Form I-924 application, including the actual project details or the first Form I-526 immigrant investor petition). Organizational and transactional supporting documents are not required for a hypothetical project. If a regional center applicant desires a compliance review of organizational and transactional documents, the application must include an actual project with a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant business plan and an exemplar immigrant investor petition. 2. Actual Projects Applications for regional center designation based on actual projects may require more details than a hypothetical project to demonstrate that the proposal contains verifiable details and is supported by economically or statistically sound forecasting tools. A regional center applicant seeking review of an actual project should clarify in the Form I-924 submission that the project is actual. Actual projects require a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant comprehensive business plan that provides verifiable detail on how jobs will be created. Absent fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legal deficiency, [11] USCIS defers to prior determinations based on actual projects when evaluating subsequent filings under the project involving the same material facts and issues. Organizational and transactional documents for the new commercial enterprise are not required. If a regional center applicant desires review of organizational and transactional documents for program compliance, the regional center application must be accompanied by an exemplar Form I-526 immigrant investor petition. If regional center applicants opt not to file a Form I-924 amendment, the investor should identify his or her Form I-526 immigrant investor petition as an actual project being presented for the first time. Additionally, the immigrant petition should contain an affirmative statement signed by a regional center principal confirming that the regional center is aware of the specific project being presented for the first time as part of the immigrant investor petition. In cases where the regional center application is filed based on actual projects that do not contain sufficient verifiable detail, USCIS may approve the projects as hypothetical projects if they contain", "metadata": {"id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6", "title": "Volume 6 - Immigrants | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff-3"}}
{"text": "compliance, the regional center application must be accompanied by an exemplar Form I-526 immigrant investor petition. If regional center applicants opt not to file a Form I-924 amendment, the investor should identify his or her Form I-526 immigrant investor petition as an actual project being presented for the first time. Additionally, the immigrant petition should contain an affirmative statement signed by a regional center principal confirming that the regional center is aware of the specific project being presented for the first time as part of the immigrant investor petition. In cases where the regional center application is filed based on actual projects that do not contain sufficient verifiable detail, USCIS may approve the projects as hypothetical projects if they contain the requisite general proposals and predictions. The projects approved as hypotheticals, however, do not receive deference in subsequent filings. In cases where some projects are approvable as actual projects, and others are not approvable or only approvable as hypothetical projects, the approval notice should identify which projects have been approved as actual projects and will be accorded deference. The approval notice should also identify projects that have been approved as hypothetical projects but will not be accorded deference. 3. Exemplar Filings Regional center applications, based on actual projects, including a Form I-526 immigrant investor exemplar petition, require more details than a hypothetical or actual project submitted without an exemplar. A regional center applicant seeking review of an exemplar should state that the project is an actual project with a Form I-526 exemplar. Exemplar filings require a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant comprehensive business plan that provides verifiable detail on how jobs will be created, as well as organizational and transactional documents for the new commercial enterprise. Absent fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legal deficiency, officer determinations based on exemplar filings are accorded deference in subsequent filings under the project with the same material facts and issues. While an amended Form I-924 is not required to perfect a hypothetical project once the actual project details are available, some applicants may choose to file an amended Form I-924 application with a Form I-526 exemplar to obtain a favorable determination. These exemplar filings are accorded deference in subsequent related filings, absent material change, fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legally deficient determination. C. Regional Center Annual Reporting Designated regional centers must file a Supplement to Form I-924 (Form I-924A) annually that demonstrates continued eligibility for designation as a regional center in the EB-5 Program. [12] The regional center must file the form within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year (between October 1 and December 29). The Form I-924A instructions specifically list required information that must be submitted. [13] If the regional center fails to file the required annual report, USCIS issues a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) to the regional center for failing to provide the required information. This may ultimately result in the termination of the regional center’s designation if the regional center fails to respond or does not file a response which adequately demonstrates continued eligibility. D. Regional Center Amendments Because businesses’ strategies constantly evolve, with new opportunities identified and existing plans improved, a regional center may amend a previously approved designation. The Form I-924 instructions provide information regarding the submission of regional center amendment requests. [14] To improve processing efficiencies and predictability in subsequent filings, many regional centers may seek to amend the Form I-924 approval to reflect changes in economic analysis and job creation estimates. Such amendments, however, are not required in order for individual investors to proceed with filing the immigrant petitions or petitions to remove conditions on residence based on the additional jobs created, or to be created, in additional industries. Formal amendments to an approved regional center’s designation are not required when a regional center changes its industries of focus, business plans, or economic methodologies; however, a regional center may find it advantageous to seek USCIS approval of such changes before they are adjudicated in individual immigrant investor petitions. Requests to Change Geographic Area When a regional center requests to expand its geographic area, the proposed geographic area must be limited, contiguous, and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. [15] Any requests for geographic area expansion made on or after February 22, 2017 are adjudicated under the current guidance in the Form I-924 instructions which requires that a Form I-924 amendment must be filed, and approved, to expand the regional center’s geographic area. The Form I-924 amendment must be approved before an I-526 petitioner may demonstrate eligibility at the time of filing his or her petition based on an investment in the expanded area. If the regional center’s geographic area expansion request was submitted either through a Form I-924 amendment or Form I-526 petition filed prior to", "metadata": {"id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6", "title": "Volume 6 - Immigrants | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff-4"}}

The Form I-924 amendment must be approved before an I-526 petitioner may demonstrate eligibility at the time of filing his or her petition based on an investment in the expanded area. If the regional center’s geographic area expansion request was submitted either through a Form I-924 amendment or Form I-526 petition filed prior to February 22, 2017, and the request is ultimately approved, USCIS will continue to adjudicate additional Form I-526 petitions associated with investments in that area under prior policy guidance issued on May 30, 2013. [16] That policy did not require a formal amendment to expand a regional center’s geographic area, and permitted concurrent filing of the Form I-526 prior to approval of the geographic area amendment. E. Termination of a Regional Center Designation USCIS issues a NOIT if: USCIS determines that a regional center no longer serves the purpose of promoting economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment; or The regional center fails to submit required information to USCIS. [17] The NOIT will provide the grounds for termination and provide at least 30 days from receipt of the NOIT for the regional center to respond to the allegations in the NOIT. The regional center may offer evidence to contest the allegations in the NOIT. If the regional center overcomes the allegations in the NOIT, USCIS issues a Notice of Reaffirmation that affirms the regional center’s designation. If the regional center fails to overcome the allegations in the NOIT, USCIS terminates the regional center’s participation in the Regional Center Program. In this case, USCIS notifies the regional center of the termination, the reasons for termination, and the right to file a motion, appeal, or both. The regional center may appeal the decision to USCIS’ Administrative Appeals Office within 30 days after service of notice (33 days, if the notice was mailed).

[6] These updates and clarifications of current USCIS policy guidance are based on USCIS interpretation of the applicable terms in DHS regulations and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue an interpretive rule or one that amends or repeals an existing interpretive rule, [7] or when modifying rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. [8] However, the instruction to not require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification was a policy change in response to the resource strain of ongoing litigation. As with all other policy guidance USCIS issues, these updates and clarifications to officers do not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights, obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS will evaluate SIJ petitions. Accordingly, USCIS published no Federal Register notices requesting public comment because public notice is not required for these internal policy changes and clarifications.

{"text": "practice. [8] However, the instruction to not require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification was a policy change in response to the resource strain of ongoing litigation. As with all other policy guidance USCIS issues, these updates and clarifications to officers do not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights, obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS will evaluate SIJ petitions. Accordingly, USCIS published no Federal Register notices requesting public comment because public notice is not required for these internal policy changes and clarifications. Unfair Surprise and Reliance Interest An agency can change its interpretation of a regulation at different times in its history as long as the interpretative changes create no unfair surprise. [9] In this case, USCIS is not changing its policy regarding SIJ adjudications. USCIS is updating this guidance to clarify what the law and regulations permit or require because of potential confusion. It has never been USCIS official policy to grant SIJ classification based on a state judge’s order that is sought primarily to permit the alien to obtain lawful immigration status. USCIS has analyzed the potential for and taken into account serious reliance interests that may be engendered by the practices USCIS officers may have followed prior to this clarification. USCIS acknowledges that a person who may have been approved for SIJ classification before this policy alert may no longer be approved by an officer following this clarifying guidance in rendering their decision. An advocate or representative of an SIJ petitioner, not knowing of this policy, may erroneously petition the state court judge who is handling their client’s case to issue an order with findings of fact in support of the petitioner’s eligibility for SIJ that does not provide relief from parental abuse, neglect, abandonment or a similar basis under state law. However, the statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria have never permitted SIJ classification to be approved using such state court orders, nor has it been official USCIS policy. Therefore, an SIJ petitioner cannot be said to have acted in reliance on the continuation of a practice and policy that has not been a USCIS practice and policy and which is contrary to the law. USCIS must limit the approval of SIJ classification to cases who are eligible based on a valid court order as required by the INA regardless of its effects on parties who may rely on erroneous state court orders. With respect to the policy change to no longer require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification, USCIS made that change in response to the strain of litigation. USCIS anticipated that the change would not negatively impact petitioners with potential reliance interests, rather it would reduce their evidentiary burden. Implementation USCIS implemented this policy update immediately, as it was merely a clarification. However, USCIS still allowed interested parties an opportunity to comment by providing a 10-day comment period, as is generally provided for Policy Manual publications.

{"text": "of State Diversity Visa Instructions Department of State Electronic Diversity Visa Program How to Use the USCIS Policy Manual Website Visa Bulletin Appendices Appendix: Update on Interpretation of Sought to Acquire The INA 203(h) age calculation applies provided the applicant “sought to acquire” lawful permanent resident (LPR) status within 1 year of a visa becoming available. In Matter of O. Vazquez, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found that the term “sought to acquire” was ambiguous and that the alien might also satisfy the provision “by showing that there are extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond their control.” [1] However, neither Matter of O. Vasquez nor other authorities address how to treat the visa availability periods of less than 1 year that coincide with an alien’s period of extraordinary circumstances for purposes of INA 203(h) . In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, USCIS provides the applicant with another 1-year period to seek to acquire when the visa next becomes available again solely to ensure that the applicant has the benefit of the entire 1-year period afforded by Congress under INA 203(h) [2] Once the visa next becomes available, the applicant’s Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) age is calculated based on this next visa availability date. [3] USCIS has not previously issued policy guidance regarding extraordinary circumstances and the unavailability of a visa. In accordance with Matter of O. Vazquez, if the applicant establishes that extraordinary circumstances prevented the potential applicant from timely filing an adjustment of status application or otherwise seeking to acquire LPR status when a visa is available for less than a year, then it is reasonable for the agency to find that the applicant satisfied the sought to acquire provision during that period. Because USCIS had not previously addressed the issue of extraordinary circumstances and failure to seek to acquire prior to unavailability, the foregoing policy is new guidance. Accordingly, USCIS is supplementing its interpretation here. If USCIS were to account for extraordinary circumstances only during periods when the visa was available for a continuous 1-year period, but not during periods when the visa was available for less than 1 year, then USCIS would have to use the next visa availability date for purposes of an age calculation. [4] This would be the case even though it was beyond the control of the applicant to file earlier because of extraordinary circumstances. USCIS believes such an interpretation of the sought to acquire requirement, considering the statutory scheme limiting visa availability and the potential for visa retrogression in preference cases, does not comport with the interpretation of “sought to acquire” as provided in the BIA’s decision in Matter of O. Vazquez By issuing this guidance, USCIS is clarifying the interplay between the statutory scheme governing visa limitations and the BIA’s interpretation of “sought to acquire.” Through this guidance, USCIS provides new, clear instructions and ensures a uniform approach within the agency. The updated guidance, moreover, is consistent with the purpose of the CSPA, to protect certain beneficiaries from losing eligibility for immigrant visas due to aging out. USCIS also has considered the extent to which this policy update may adversely impact interested parties or upset reliance interests. Given that the guidance is a product of an interplay between statutory provisions governing visa limitation and binding BIA precedent, and the fact that USCIS previously did not have any guidance on the issue of a visa becoming unavailable during the first year of availability, the existence of extraordinary circumstances during the initial period of availability, and failure to seek to acquire during the initial period of availability, USCIS believes interested parties will have only developed serious reliance interests, if at all, based on the holding of Matter of O. Vazquez USCIS recognizes that given the visa allocation scheme provided by Congress, this new policy guidance means that some aliens may be eligible for CSPA benefits because they will be considered a child based on an earlier visa availability date, which in turn may cause other visa applicants to wait longer for an available visa. However, the current statutory scheme which permits certain individuals to be considered children for immigration purposes already results in other aliens having to wait longer for a visa to become available. Given that the updated guidance aims to ensures a uniform interpretation of law and provide guidance in an area that has not been expressly addressed, the implications of this guidance are generally likely to adversely affect the same proportion of individuals as those impacted by USCIS’ current implementation of CSPA. USCIS considers this impact to be outweighed by the benefits of avoiding family separation so that eligible aliens may adjust status with their parents. For these reasons, USCIS believes that, if there are any,", "metadata": {"id": "606957191685fdd3", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7", "title": "Volume 7 - Adjustment of Status | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "606957191685fdd3-3"}}

For these reasons, USCIS believes that, if there are any, reliance interests do not outweigh the benefits provided by this updated guidance. Therefore, USCIS believes that Matter of O. Vazquez is best implemented by considering an applicant to satisfy the sought to acquire provision when the visa is available for less than 1 year if the alien did not apply during that period but the period is covered by extraordinary circumstances.

Vazquez (PDF) , 25 I&N Dec. 817, 820 (BIA 2012) (“Moreover, an alien might satisfy the ‘sought to acquire’ provision by showing that there are other extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond the alien’s control.”).

[1] Previously, USCIS issued policy guidance on February 14, 2023, that considered an immigrant visa available for CSPA age calculation at the same time USCIS considered a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application. [2] For purposes of determining visa availability, USCIS consults the DOS Visa Bulletin. [3] Until October 2015, DOS published only one chart in the Visa Bulletin that allowed USCIS officers to assess when a visa was available for allocation and issuance. That Visa Bulletin chart in effect corresponded to what is currently the “Final Action Dates” chart. In October 2015, DOS began publishing two charts in the DOS Visa Bulletin consisting of a “Dates for Filing” chart (which notifies beneficiaries when they may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center (NVC)) and a Final Action Dates chart (which informs when a visa is authorized for issuance). Between the enactment of the CSPA in 2002 and October 2015, it was understood that an immigrant visa “bec[ame] available” for the CSPA age calculation based on the chart published in the Visa Bulletin now known as the Final Action Dates chart. On May 23, 2018, following the publication of the two charts in the Visa Bulletin, USCIS issued policy guidance clarifying that it continued to only consider a visa available for the CSPA age calculation based on the Final Action Dates chart. [4] On February 14, 2023, USCIS issued updated policy guidance that a visa becomes available to calculate CSPA age for an alien at the same time USCIS considers a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application. [5] When USCIS determined there were more immigrant visas available for a fiscal year than there were known aliens for such visas, and USCIS designated the Dates for Filing chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin [6] to determine eligibility for filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Dates for Filing chart when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. When USCIS designated the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin for use by aliens when filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Final Action Dates when calculating the alien’s CSPA age.

When USCIS designated the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin for use by aliens when filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Final Action Dates when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. [7] Neither CSPA nor DHS regulations define when a visa becomes available for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under INA 203(h) , and there are no precedent federal court decisions or published administrative decisions on this issue. USCIS carefully considered the February 14, 2023 interpretation of INA 203(h) , including in light of the Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo Loper Bright [8] USCIS believes that utilizing the Final Action Date is the most faithful alignment with the statutory text of INA 203(h) [9] and the structure of INA 203 as a whole, [10] and effectuates the purpose of INA 203(h) as recognized by courts. [11] Contrasted with INA 201(f)(1) , which broadly freezes the age of certain immediate relatives on the date of filing the immigrant petition, INA 203(h)(1) permits only certain preference aliens to be deemed a child for immigration purposes based on a particular formula which, when enacted, was centered around when a visa could actually be allocated and used for adjustment of status or immigrant visa processing. For adjustment cases, the application of the provisions of INA 203(h) is generally a retrospective analysis conducted at the time of final adjustment adjudication alone as opposed to eligibility to file under INA 245(a) Furthermore, using the Final Action Date chart is most consistent with the longstanding interpretation of INA 203(h) that USCIS had relied on prior to February 14, 2023, and is closest to the contemporaneous understanding of visa availability at the time Congress enacted CSPA. Interpretations issued contemporaneously with the statute, and which have remained consistent over time, are especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning. [12] When Congress enacted CSPA, it did so with the knowledge and understanding of existing law and processes provided by the agencies within their authorities and expertise, including the operation of the DOS Visa Bulletin. [13] DOS and USCIS utilized the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under INA 203(h) until the February 14, 2023 policy change, and this interpretation had remained consistent for over 20 years. Finally, by returning to the Final Action Dates chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation, [14] DHS ensures a uniform interpretation of INA 203(h) across government agencies and establishes parity for CSPA age calculations for aliens who apply for adjustment of status with USCIS and immigrant visas with DOS. After the February 14, 2023 policy update, USCIS and DOS interpreted INA 203(h) inconsistently, which resulted in inconsistent treatment of aliens who applied for adjustment of status in the United States and aliens who applied for an immigrant visa with DOS abroad. Even after implementing the October 2015 changes to the Visa Bulletin, DOS considered the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin as the only dates that should be used to calculate the CSPA age for aliens who apply for an immigrant visa. [15] Therefore, an alien filing for adjustment of status in the United States may have been considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA when USCIS designates the earlier dates in the Dates for Filing chart while an alien who must apply for an immigrant visa outside the United States may have been ineligible to immigrate as a child if his or her calculated CSPA age is 21 or older when a visa became available according to the later dates in the Final Action Dates chart. [16] USCIS is cognizant that the February 14, 2023 policy may have engendered reliance interests, and USCIS has assessed the impact of this policy change on aliens, including aliens with a pending adjustment of status application. This policy change means that the alien could have a visa immediately available for purposes of filing the adjustment of status application while a visa may not have become available under the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA calculation, if USCIS designates the Dates of Filing chart for purposes of filing adjustment of status applications in a given month. In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he", "metadata": {"id": "606957191685fdd3", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7", "title": "Volume 7 - Adjustment of Status | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "606957191685fdd3-5"}}
{"text": "Dates chart. [16] USCIS is cognizant that the February 14, 2023 policy may have engendered reliance interests, and USCIS has assessed the impact of this policy change on aliens, including aliens with a pending adjustment of status application. This policy change means that the alien could have a visa immediately available for purposes of filing the adjustment of status application while a visa may not have become available under the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA calculation, if USCIS designates the Dates of Filing chart for purposes of filing adjustment of status applications in a given month. In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he or she would be considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA and, thus, whether the alien would be eligible for adjustment of status application once a visa is available to calculate his or her CSPA age. That was one of the triggering reasons for the February 14, 2023 policy. However, as explained, the February 14, 2023 policy has neither been longstanding nor are these considerations of such nature that they would be engendering significant reliance interests for aliens who are impacted by the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, specifically, aliens who have not yet filed adjustment of status applications. [17] Every alien filing a request with USCIS assumes the risk that he or she may be ineligible for the benefit under U.S. immigration laws, and thus, may have paid a USCIS fee without obtaining the benefit. Aliens seeking eligibility to adjust status believing that they are considered a child under CSPA are no different. The short duration of the policy, and the lack of associated rights related to the February 14, 2023 guidance for aliens who file adjustment of status applications after the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, the fact that such aliens have not paid a fee for an adjustment of status application, and the absence of any guarantee that the alien would be eligible to remain a child under INA 203(h) or that the application for adjustment of status will be approved as a matter of discretion dilutes the strength of the alien’s reliance on the past practice. [18] Thus, while USCIS is always cognizant of any reliance interests no matter how small, USCIS believes that, for the reasons outlined in the policy guidance, the policy concerns addressed with this update outweigh the alien’s concerns that prompted the February 14, 2023 policy. [19] To address reliance interests of those aliens who have already filed adjustment of status applications, USCIS determined that it will apply this policy change prospectively only to applications filed on or after August 15, 2025. USCIS continues to apply the February 14, 2023 policy to aliens whose adjustment of status application are pending with USCIS before August 15, 2025. Moreover, if an alien demonstrates extraordinary circumstances for not applying for adjustment of status during the period of the former policy between February 14, 2023 and August 14, 2025 where a visa was available for CSPA age calculations at the same time a visa was immediately available for an alien to apply for adjustment of status under the February 14, 2023 policy, USCIS calculates the alien’s age under that former policy.

The holding in this District court decision does not have precedential value and is not binding on USCIS, see, for example, Matter of Rosales Vargas , 27 I&N Dec. 745, 749 n.7 (BIA 2020); nevertheless, USCIS believes that the reasoning contained in this decision is persuasive in the context of “becomes available” under INA 203(h) [^ 10] Congress embedded INA 203(h) within INA 203 , which addresses the allocation of immigrant visas generally. In this section, Congress authorized DOS to administer the visa quota system consistent with numerical limitations imposed by Congress. See INA 203(e)-(g) . The statute authorizes DOS to make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued and to rely on those numbers when authorizing the issuance of immigrant visas. See INA 203(e)-(g) . See 22 CFR 42.51 and 22 CFR 42.54 . The availability of an immigrant visa under INA 203(h) is thus closely tied to DOS’ allocation of immigrant visa numbers for the issuance of immigrant visas, for which DOS uses the Final Action Dates chart. See INA 245(b) (upon approval of an adjustment of status application under INA 245(a) , DOS reduces the number of corresponding visas authorized for issuance under INA 202 and INA 203 by one within the class to which the alien is chargeable for the fiscal year then current). [^ 11] In analyzing the statute’s plain language and structure, as well as Congress’ contemporaneous understanding of immigration law at the time of the CSPA’s enactment, courts have recognized that Congress only intended the CSPA to address children aging out because of delays in the adjudication of immigrant petitions, not because of delays due to statutory limits on visa allocations. For example, see Scialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio , 573 U.S. 41, 53 (2014) (plurality op.) (“But the time in between—the months or, more likely, years the alien spends simply waiting for a visa to become available—is not similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the immigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions, can still ‘age out’ . . . prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.”). Using the Final Action Dates chart is more consistent with this purpose because it only mitigates the consequences of the administrative delays, but not any additional time spent waiting before DOS can authorize a visa number for issuance. [^ 12] See Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (PDF) 603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024). [^ 13] For example, see H.R. Rep. 107-45 , p. 2, 2002 U.S.C.C.A.N. 640, 641(2001) (describing the mechanics of immigrant visa availability and the associated waiting list). [^ 14] As it is the case with all USCIS Policy Manual guidance, this update to current USCIS policy guidance is based on USCIS’ interpretation of the applicable terms in the INA and the necessary policies and procedures to implement them. An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue interpretive rules, general statements of policy or rules of agency organization and procedure or practice. See 5 U.S.C. 553 . Additionally, this policy guidance relates to the efforts of USCIS to control the status, exit, and entry of aliens, which constitutes a foreign affairs function under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. 553 . See Determination: Foreign Affairs Functions of the United States, 90 FR 12200 (PDF) (Mar. 14, 2025).

[5] Under prior practice, USCIS applied the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections indefinitely. This has meant that USCIS maintained these protections even after naturalization. These protections offer important safeguards: an unauthorized disclosure of information that relates to a protected person can have significant consequences. However, the protections under 8 U.S.C. 1367 can pose barriers to accessing USCIS customer service tools and electronic benefit processing after naturalization because of identity verification requirements. [6] 8 U.S.C. 1367 was designed to “ensure that abusers and criminals cannot use the immigration system against their victims,” such as by obtaining information about the existence of immigration benefit requests, “interfering with or undermining their victims’ immigration cases,” or “encouraging immigration enforcement", "metadata": {"id": "42ad68a914c1b86b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-1", "title": "Volume 1 - General Policies and Procedures | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "42ad68a914c1b86b-0"}}

This has meant that USCIS maintained these protections even after naturalization. These protections offer important safeguards: an unauthorized disclosure of information that relates to a protected person can have significant consequences. However, the protections under 8 U.S.C. 1367 can pose barriers to accessing USCIS customer service tools and electronic benefit processing after naturalization because of identity verification requirements. [6] 8 U.S.C. 1367 was designed to “ensure that abusers and criminals cannot use the immigration system against their victims,” such as by obtaining information about the existence of immigration benefit requests, “interfering with or undermining their victims’ immigration cases,” or “encouraging immigration enforcement officers to pursue removal actions against their victims.” [7] After naturalization, the concerns underlying the creation of 8 U.S.C. 1367 become less relevant and necessary as a safety mechanism: naturalized citizens are no longer subject to removal and can travel and work without seeking permission from USCIS. However, because USCIS continued to apply the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections after naturalization, naturalized citizens who needed to interface with USCIS continued to face limitations in accessing USCIS’ telephonic and electronic customer service tools. 8 U.S.C. 1367 protects “any information which relates to an alien who is the beneficiary of an application for relief under paragraph (15)(T), (15)(U), or (51) of section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T), (U), (51)] or section 240A(b)(2) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(2)].” [8] “Alien” is defined at INA 101(a)(3) as “any person not a citizen or national of the United States.” Upon naturalization, persons protected by 8 U.S.C. 1367 become citizens and are no longer aliens; therefore, the use of the term “alien” at 8 U.S.C. 1367 authorizes USCIS to terminate these protections at naturalization. In addition, the regulations at 8 CFR 214.14(e)(1) (relating to disclosure protections for U nonimmigrants) and 8 CFR 211.1(p)(1) (relating to T nonimmigrants) apply protections to a “beneficiary of a pending or approved petition for U [or T] nonimmigrant status,” which can reasonably be understood to refer to beneficiaries up to, but not including, naturalized citizens. By interpreting the protections under 8 U.S.C. 1367 to terminate at naturalization, USCIS continues to comply with the statutory confidentiality protections for aliens but reduces the burden and inefficiencies for naturalized citizens. B. Administrative Procedure Act Considerations The Administrative Procedure Act excepts interpretive rules; general statements of policy; and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice and comment requirements. [9] On June 12, 2024, USCIS updated the Policy Manual to notify the public of its interpretation of “alien who is the beneficiary of an application for relief under paragraph (15)(T), (15)(U), or (51) of section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T), (U), (51)] or section 240A(b)(2) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(2)]” at 8 U.S.C. 1367 and explain that it is changing its policy to no longer apply the protections under that section to all previously protected naturalized citizens, including those who naturalized prior to the effective date of this policy, as a result of this interpretation. [10] USCIS’ interpretation is reasonable because “alien” is defined at INA 101(a)(3) as “any person not a citizen or national of the United States.” USCIS interprets the protections at 8 U.S.C. 1367 to terminate upon naturalization because the formerly protected persons are no longer aliens, as defined by statute. This interpretation is based on the plain language of 8 U.S.C. 1367 and INA 101(a)(3) and is consistent with the legislative intent of 8 U.S.C. 1367. [11] The Policy Manual guidance explains and provides clarification to officers but does not add to or subtract from the statutory protections or the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights or obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS evaluates applications for immigration benefit requests. This interpretive change promotes equitable and efficient processing for all naturalized citizens, regardless of whether they were previously subject to 8 U.S.C. 1367. USCIS recognizes that this is a change in long-standing practice and accordingly considered serious reliance interests that may be engendered by the practices of USCIS officers before this interpretation. USCIS also considered the possible unfair surprise for those previously protected naturalized citizens. USCIS acknowledges that persons protected by 8 U.S.C. 1367 had protections continuing after naturalization that prohibited sharing any information about them unless certain requirements were met. However, USCIS ultimately determined that termination of the additional stringent requirements of protecting confidentiality does not place naturalized citizens at greater risk. USCIS does not release personal identifying information without an authorized purpose and proper verification. Additionally, USCIS maintains the ability to re-apply the protections, should questions arise regarding citizenship eligibility. Further, a naturalized U.S. citizen’s derivative beneficiaries remain protected by statute until the individual beneficiary", "metadata": {"id": "42ad68a914c1b86b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-1", "title": "Volume 1 - General Policies and Procedures | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "42ad68a914c1b86b-1"}}

Further, a naturalized U.S. citizen’s derivative beneficiaries remain protected by statute until the individual beneficiary becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen. USCIS believes the overall benefits of this interpretive change outweigh any potential adverse impacts and are aligned with the plain language of the statute. Implementation USCIS delayed implementation of this policy until 30 days after publication. Upon implementation, USCIS stopped applying the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections to all naturalized citizens, including those who previously naturalized and those who naturalize on or after the effective date of this policy.

[4] USCIS also extends the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1367 to abused spouses of certain persons applying for employment authorization under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). [5] Under prior practice, USCIS applied the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections indefinitely. This has meant that USCIS maintained these protections even after naturalization. These protections offer important safeguards: an unauthorized disclosure of information that relates to a protected person can have significant consequences. However, the protections under 8 U.S.C. 1367 can pose barriers to accessing USCIS customer service tools and electronic benefit processing after naturalization because of identity verification requirements. [6] 8 U.S.C. 1367 was designed to “ensure that abusers and criminals cannot use the immigration system against their victims,” such as by obtaining information about the existence of immigration benefit requests, “interfering with or undermining their victims’ immigration cases,” or “encouraging immigration enforcement officers to pursue removal actions against their victims.” [7] After naturalization, the concerns underlying the creation of 8 U.S.C. 1367 become less relevant and necessary as a safety mechanism: naturalized citizens are no longer subject to removal and can travel and work without seeking permission from USCIS. However, because USCIS continued to apply the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections after naturalization, naturalized citizens who needed to interface with USCIS continued to face limitations in accessing USCIS’ telephonic and electronic customer service tools. 8 U.S.C. 1367 protects “any information which relates to an alien who is the beneficiary of an application for relief under paragraph (15)(T), (15)(U), or (51) of section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T), (U), (51)] or section 240A(b)(2) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(2)].” [8] “Alien” is defined at INA 101(a)(3) as “any person not a citizen or national of the United States.” Upon naturalization, persons protected by 8 U.S.C. 1367 become citizens and are no longer aliens; therefore, the use of the term “alien” at 8 U.S.C. 1367 authorizes USCIS to terminate these protections at naturalization. In addition, the regulations at 8 CFR 214.14(e)(1) (relating to disclosure protections for U nonimmigrants) and 8 CFR 211.1(p)(1) (relating to T nonimmigrants) apply protections to a “beneficiary of a pending or approved petition for U [or T] nonimmigrant status,” which can reasonably be understood to refer to beneficiaries up to, but not including, naturalized citizens. By interpreting the protections under 8 U.S.C. 1367 to terminate at naturalization, USCIS continues to comply with the statutory confidentiality protections for aliens but reduces the burden and inefficiencies for naturalized citizens. B. Administrative Procedure Act Considerations The Administrative Procedure Act excepts interpretive rules; general statements of policy; and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice and comment requirements. [9] On June 12, 2024, USCIS updated the Policy Manual to notify the public of its interpretation of “alien who is the beneficiary of an application for relief under paragraph (15)(T), (15)(U), or (51) of section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T), (U), (51)] or section 240A(b)(2) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(2)]” at 8 U.S.C. 1367 and explain that it is changing its policy to no longer apply the protections under that section to all previously protected naturalized citizens, including those who naturalized prior to the effective date of this policy, as a result of this interpretation. [10] USCIS’ interpretation is reasonable because “alien” is defined at INA 101(a)(3) as “any person not a citizen or national of the United States.” USCIS interprets the protections at 8 U.S.C. 1367 to terminate upon naturalization because the formerly protected persons are no longer aliens, as defined by statute.

[11] The Policy Manual guidance explains and provides clarification to officers but does not add to or subtract from the statutory protections or the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights or obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS evaluates applications for immigration benefit requests. This interpretive change promotes equitable and efficient processing for all naturalized citizens, regardless of whether they were previously subject to 8 U.S.C. 1367. USCIS recognizes that this is a change in long-standing practice and accordingly considered serious reliance interests that may be engendered by the practices of USCIS officers before this interpretation. USCIS also considered the possible unfair surprise for those previously protected naturalized citizens. USCIS acknowledges that persons protected by 8 U.S.C. 1367 had protections continuing after naturalization that prohibited sharing any information about them unless certain requirements were met. However, USCIS ultimately determined that termination of the additional stringent requirements of protecting confidentiality does not place naturalized citizens at greater risk. USCIS does not release personal identifying information without an authorized purpose and proper verification. Additionally, USCIS maintains the ability to re-apply the protections, should questions arise regarding citizenship eligibility. Further, a naturalized U.S. citizen’s derivative beneficiaries remain protected by statute until the individual beneficiary becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen. USCIS believes the overall benefits of this interpretive change outweigh any potential adverse impacts and are aligned with the plain language of the statute. Implementation USCIS delayed implementation of this policy until 30 days after publication. Upon implementation, USCIS stopped applying the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections to all naturalized citizens, including those who previously naturalized and those who naturalize on or after the effective date of this policy.

[3] This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” at INA 101(a)(33) and language in INA 322(a) and INA 322(d) , which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320. [4] On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted, [5] amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met. The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020. Footnotes [^ 1] Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship under INA 322 since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements under INA 320 as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

See Cheneau v. Garland (PDF) , 997 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2021). See Nwozuzu v. Holder , 726 F.3d 323 (2nd Cir. 2013). The courts have not defined “objective official manifestation of permanent residence,” but it includes situations where a child is physically residing in the United States, intends to reside in the United States permanently, and has taken some official action to accomplish that (such as applying for lawful permanent residence with USCIS). For questions about which other circumstances may qualify as an “objective official manifestation of permanent residence,” officers should contact the Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC). [^ 7] The definition of “both parents” as found in former INA 321 and former INA 320, Pub. L 82-414 (PDF) , 66 Stat. 163, 245 (June 27, 1952) includes: The surviving parent should the other parent die; The naturalized parent having legal custody in the case of a divorce or a legal separation; The mother of a child born out of wedlock, as long as the child had not been legitimated (if a child was properly legitimated under the age of 16, the law required both parents to naturalize); or The alien parent who naturalizes when the other parent is already a U.S. citizen since the child’s birth. [^ 8] Adopted children may still derive from their biological parents if all other requirements are met, provided that the child’s adoption did not terminate the parental relationship with the naturalized parent or parents. For example, a child who was born out of wedlock to alien parents may still derive citizenship from the mother in cases where: Paternity was not established by legitimation; The child was adopted by the stepfather; and The child’s biological mother naturalized. This is because the adoption did not alter the child’s legal relationship with the mother.

Footnotes [^ 1] Since the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952, Pub. L. 82-414 (PDF) (June 27, 1952), Congress has provided for the naturalization of a child under age 18 upon petition by the U.S. citizen parent. See INA 322 . The requirements varied with different amendments, but naturalization under this provision always required an application or petition by the parent; citizenship was not automatic.

[3] This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” at INA 101(a)(33) and language in INA 322(a) and INA 322(d) , which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320. [4] On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted, [5] amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met. The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020. Footnotes [^ 1] Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship under INA 322 since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements under INA 320 as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship. [^ 2] For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government.", "metadata": {"id": "2cf7d129ac73db66", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12-part-a", "title": "Part A - Citizenship and Naturalization Policies and Procedures | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "2cf7d129ac73db66-0"}}

[3] This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” at INA 101(a)(33) and language in INA 322(a) and INA 322(d) , which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320. [4] On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted, [5] amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met. The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020. Footnotes [^ 1] Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship under INA 322 since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements under INA 320 as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship. [^ 2] For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government.

[3] This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” at INA 101(a)(33) and language in INA 322(a) and INA 322(d) , which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.

[4] On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted, [5] amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met. The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020. Footnotes [^ 1] Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship under INA 322 since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements under INA 320 as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship. [^ 2] For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government.

[3] This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” at INA 101(a)(33) and language in INA 322(a) and INA 322(d) , which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320. [4] On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted, [5] amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met. The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020. Footnotes [^ 1] Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship under INA 322 since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements under INA 320 as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship. [^ 2] For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government.

{"text": "of State Diversity Visa Instructions Department of State Electronic Diversity Visa Program How to Use the USCIS Policy Manual Website Visa Bulletin Appendices Appendix: Update on Interpretation of Sought to Acquire The INA 203(h) age calculation applies provided the applicant “sought to acquire” lawful permanent resident (LPR) status within 1 year of a visa becoming available. In Matter of O. Vazquez, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found that the term “sought to acquire” was ambiguous and that the alien might also satisfy the provision “by showing that there are extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond their control.” [1] However, neither Matter of O. Vasquez nor other authorities address how to treat the visa availability periods of less than 1 year that coincide with an alien’s period of extraordinary circumstances for purposes of INA 203(h) . In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, USCIS provides the applicant with another 1-year period to seek to acquire when the visa next becomes available again solely to ensure that the applicant has the benefit of the entire 1-year period afforded by Congress under INA 203(h) [2] Once the visa next becomes available, the applicant’s Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) age is calculated based on this next visa availability date. [3] USCIS has not previously issued policy guidance regarding extraordinary circumstances and the unavailability of a visa. In accordance with Matter of O. Vazquez, if the applicant establishes that extraordinary circumstances prevented the potential applicant from timely filing an adjustment of status application or otherwise seeking to acquire LPR status when a visa is available for less than a year, then it is reasonable for the agency to find that the applicant satisfied the sought to acquire provision during that period. Because USCIS had not previously addressed the issue of extraordinary circumstances and failure to seek to acquire prior to unavailability, the foregoing policy is new guidance. Accordingly, USCIS is supplementing its interpretation here. If USCIS were to account for extraordinary circumstances only during periods when the visa was available for a continuous 1-year period, but not during periods when the visa was available for less than 1 year, then USCIS would have to use the next visa availability date for purposes of an age calculation. [4] This would be the case even though it was beyond the control of the applicant to file earlier because of extraordinary circumstances. USCIS believes such an interpretation of the sought to acquire requirement, considering the statutory scheme limiting visa availability and the potential for visa retrogression in preference cases, does not comport with the interpretation of “sought to acquire” as provided in the BIA’s decision in Matter of O. Vazquez By issuing this guidance, USCIS is clarifying the interplay between the statutory scheme governing visa limitations and the BIA’s interpretation of “sought to acquire.” Through this guidance, USCIS provides new, clear instructions and ensures a uniform approach within the agency. The updated guidance, moreover, is consistent with the purpose of the CSPA, to protect certain beneficiaries from losing eligibility for immigrant visas due to aging out. USCIS also has considered the extent to which this policy update may adversely impact interested parties or upset reliance interests. Given that the guidance is a product of an interplay between statutory provisions governing visa limitation and binding BIA precedent, and the fact that USCIS previously did not have any guidance on the issue of a visa becoming unavailable during the first year of availability, the existence of extraordinary circumstances during the initial period of availability, and failure to seek to acquire during the initial period of availability, USCIS believes interested parties will have only developed serious reliance interests, if at all, based on the holding of Matter of O. Vazquez USCIS recognizes that given the visa allocation scheme provided by Congress, this new policy guidance means that some aliens may be eligible for CSPA benefits because they will be considered a child based on an earlier visa availability date, which in turn may cause other visa applicants to wait longer for an available visa. However, the current statutory scheme which permits certain individuals to be considered children for immigration purposes already results in other aliens having to wait longer for a visa to become available. Given that the updated guidance aims to ensures a uniform interpretation of law and provide guidance in an area that has not been expressly addressed, the implications of this guidance are generally likely to adversely affect the same proportion of individuals as those impacted by USCIS’ current implementation of CSPA. USCIS considers this impact to be outweighed by the benefits of avoiding family separation so that eligible aliens may adjust status with their parents. For these reasons, USCIS believes that, if there are any,", "metadata": {"id": "606957191685fdd3", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7", "title": "Volume 7 - Adjustment of Status | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "606957191685fdd3-3"}}

For these reasons, USCIS believes that, if there are any, reliance interests do not outweigh the benefits provided by this updated guidance. Therefore, USCIS believes that Matter of O. Vazquez is best implemented by considering an applicant to satisfy the sought to acquire provision when the visa is available for less than 1 year if the alien did not apply during that period but the period is covered by extraordinary circumstances.

Vazquez (PDF) , 25 I&N Dec. 817, 820 (BIA 2012) (“Moreover, an alien might satisfy the ‘sought to acquire’ provision by showing that there are other extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond the alien’s control.”).

[1] Previously, USCIS issued policy guidance on February 14, 2023, that considered an immigrant visa available for CSPA age calculation at the same time USCIS considered a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application. [2] For purposes of determining visa availability, USCIS consults the DOS Visa Bulletin. [3] Until October 2015, DOS published only one chart in the Visa Bulletin that allowed USCIS officers to assess when a visa was available for allocation and issuance. That Visa Bulletin chart in effect corresponded to what is currently the “Final Action Dates” chart. In October 2015, DOS began publishing two charts in the DOS Visa Bulletin consisting of a “Dates for Filing” chart (which notifies beneficiaries when they may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center (NVC)) and a Final Action Dates chart (which informs when a visa is authorized for issuance). Between the enactment of the CSPA in 2002 and October 2015, it was understood that an immigrant visa “bec[ame] available” for the CSPA age calculation based on the chart published in the Visa Bulletin now known as the Final Action Dates chart. On May 23, 2018, following the publication of the two charts in the Visa Bulletin, USCIS issued policy guidance clarifying that it continued to only consider a visa available for the CSPA age calculation based on the Final Action Dates chart. [4] On February 14, 2023, USCIS issued updated policy guidance that a visa becomes available to calculate CSPA age for an alien at the same time USCIS considers a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application. [5] When USCIS determined there were more immigrant visas available for a fiscal year than there were known aliens for such visas, and USCIS designated the Dates for Filing chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin [6] to determine eligibility for filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Dates for Filing chart when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. When USCIS designated the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin for use by aliens when filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Final Action Dates when calculating the alien’s CSPA age.

When USCIS designated the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin for use by aliens when filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Final Action Dates when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. [7] Neither CSPA nor DHS regulations define when a visa becomes available for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under INA 203(h) , and there are no precedent federal court decisions or published administrative decisions on this issue. USCIS carefully considered the February 14, 2023 interpretation of INA 203(h) , including in light of the Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo Loper Bright [8] USCIS believes that utilizing the Final Action Date is the most faithful alignment with the statutory text of INA 203(h) [9] and the structure of INA 203 as a whole, [10] and effectuates the purpose of INA 203(h) as recognized by courts. [11] Contrasted with INA 201(f)(1) , which broadly freezes the age of certain immediate relatives on the date of filing the immigrant petition, INA 203(h)(1) permits only certain preference aliens to be deemed a child for immigration purposes based on a particular formula which, when enacted, was centered around when a visa could actually be allocated and used for adjustment of status or immigrant visa processing. For adjustment cases, the application of the provisions of INA 203(h) is generally a retrospective analysis conducted at the time of final adjustment adjudication alone as opposed to eligibility to file under INA 245(a) Furthermore, using the Final Action Date chart is most consistent with the longstanding interpretation of INA 203(h) that USCIS had relied on prior to February 14, 2023, and is closest to the contemporaneous understanding of visa availability at the time Congress enacted CSPA. Interpretations issued contemporaneously with the statute, and which have remained consistent over time, are especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning. [12] When Congress enacted CSPA, it did so with the knowledge and understanding of existing law and processes provided by the agencies within their authorities and expertise, including the operation of the DOS Visa Bulletin. [13] DOS and USCIS utilized the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under INA 203(h) until the February 14, 2023 policy change, and this interpretation had remained consistent for over 20 years. Finally, by returning to the Final Action Dates chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation, [14] DHS ensures a uniform interpretation of INA 203(h) across government agencies and establishes parity for CSPA age calculations for aliens who apply for adjustment of status with USCIS and immigrant visas with DOS. After the February 14, 2023 policy update, USCIS and DOS interpreted INA 203(h) inconsistently, which resulted in inconsistent treatment of aliens who applied for adjustment of status in the United States and aliens who applied for an immigrant visa with DOS abroad. Even after implementing the October 2015 changes to the Visa Bulletin, DOS considered the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin as the only dates that should be used to calculate the CSPA age for aliens who apply for an immigrant visa. [15] Therefore, an alien filing for adjustment of status in the United States may have been considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA when USCIS designates the earlier dates in the Dates for Filing chart while an alien who must apply for an immigrant visa outside the United States may have been ineligible to immigrate as a child if his or her calculated CSPA age is 21 or older when a visa became available according to the later dates in the Final Action Dates chart. [16] USCIS is cognizant that the February 14, 2023 policy may have engendered reliance interests, and USCIS has assessed the impact of this policy change on aliens, including aliens with a pending adjustment of status application. This policy change means that the alien could have a visa immediately available for purposes of filing the adjustment of status application while a visa may not have become available under the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA calculation, if USCIS designates the Dates of Filing chart for purposes of filing adjustment of status applications in a given month. In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he", "metadata": {"id": "606957191685fdd3", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7", "title": "Volume 7 - Adjustment of Status | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "606957191685fdd3-5"}}
{"text": "Dates chart. [16] USCIS is cognizant that the February 14, 2023 policy may have engendered reliance interests, and USCIS has assessed the impact of this policy change on aliens, including aliens with a pending adjustment of status application. This policy change means that the alien could have a visa immediately available for purposes of filing the adjustment of status application while a visa may not have become available under the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA calculation, if USCIS designates the Dates of Filing chart for purposes of filing adjustment of status applications in a given month. In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he or she would be considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA and, thus, whether the alien would be eligible for adjustment of status application once a visa is available to calculate his or her CSPA age. That was one of the triggering reasons for the February 14, 2023 policy. However, as explained, the February 14, 2023 policy has neither been longstanding nor are these considerations of such nature that they would be engendering significant reliance interests for aliens who are impacted by the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, specifically, aliens who have not yet filed adjustment of status applications. [17] Every alien filing a request with USCIS assumes the risk that he or she may be ineligible for the benefit under U.S. immigration laws, and thus, may have paid a USCIS fee without obtaining the benefit. Aliens seeking eligibility to adjust status believing that they are considered a child under CSPA are no different. The short duration of the policy, and the lack of associated rights related to the February 14, 2023 guidance for aliens who file adjustment of status applications after the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, the fact that such aliens have not paid a fee for an adjustment of status application, and the absence of any guarantee that the alien would be eligible to remain a child under INA 203(h) or that the application for adjustment of status will be approved as a matter of discretion dilutes the strength of the alien’s reliance on the past practice. [18] Thus, while USCIS is always cognizant of any reliance interests no matter how small, USCIS believes that, for the reasons outlined in the policy guidance, the policy concerns addressed with this update outweigh the alien’s concerns that prompted the February 14, 2023 policy. [19] To address reliance interests of those aliens who have already filed adjustment of status applications, USCIS determined that it will apply this policy change prospectively only to applications filed on or after August 15, 2025. USCIS continues to apply the February 14, 2023 policy to aliens whose adjustment of status application are pending with USCIS before August 15, 2025. Moreover, if an alien demonstrates extraordinary circumstances for not applying for adjustment of status during the period of the former policy between February 14, 2023 and August 14, 2025 where a visa was available for CSPA age calculations at the same time a visa was immediately available for an alien to apply for adjustment of status under the February 14, 2023 policy, USCIS calculates the alien’s age under that former policy.

The holding in this District court decision does not have precedential value and is not binding on USCIS, see, for example, Matter of Rosales Vargas , 27 I&N Dec. 745, 749 n.7 (BIA 2020); nevertheless, USCIS believes that the reasoning contained in this decision is persuasive in the context of “becomes available” under INA 203(h) [^ 10] Congress embedded INA 203(h) within INA 203 , which addresses the allocation of immigrant visas generally. In this section, Congress authorized DOS to administer the visa quota system consistent with numerical limitations imposed by Congress. See INA 203(e)-(g) . The statute authorizes DOS to make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued and to rely on those numbers when authorizing the issuance of immigrant visas. See INA 203(e)-(g) . See 22 CFR 42.51 and 22 CFR 42.54 . The availability of an immigrant visa under INA 203(h) is thus closely tied to DOS’ allocation of immigrant visa numbers for the issuance of immigrant visas, for which DOS uses the Final Action Dates chart. See INA 245(b) (upon approval of an adjustment of status application under INA 245(a) , DOS reduces the number of corresponding visas authorized for issuance under INA 202 and INA 203 by one within the class to which the alien is chargeable for the fiscal year then current). [^ 11] In analyzing the statute’s plain language and structure, as well as Congress’ contemporaneous understanding of immigration law at the time of the CSPA’s enactment, courts have recognized that Congress only intended the CSPA to address children aging out because of delays in the adjudication of immigrant petitions, not because of delays due to statutory limits on visa allocations. For example, see Scialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio , 573 U.S. 41, 53 (2014) (plurality op.) (“But the time in between—the months or, more likely, years the alien spends simply waiting for a visa to become available—is not similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the immigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions, can still ‘age out’ . . . prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.”). Using the Final Action Dates chart is more consistent with this purpose because it only mitigates the consequences of the administrative delays, but not any additional time spent waiting before DOS can authorize a visa number for issuance. [^ 12] See Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (PDF) 603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024). [^ 13] For example, see H.R. Rep. 107-45 , p. 2, 2002 U.S.C.C.A.N. 640, 641(2001) (describing the mechanics of immigrant visa availability and the associated waiting list). [^ 14] As it is the case with all USCIS Policy Manual guidance, this update to current USCIS policy guidance is based on USCIS’ interpretation of the applicable terms in the INA and the necessary policies and procedures to implement them. An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue interpretive rules, general statements of policy or rules of agency organization and procedure or practice. See 5 U.S.C. 553 . Additionally, this policy guidance relates to the efforts of USCIS to control the status, exit, and entry of aliens, which constitutes a foreign affairs function under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. 553 . See Determination: Foreign Affairs Functions of the United States, 90 FR 12200 (PDF) (Mar. 14, 2025).

{"text": "available. In Matter of O. Vazquez, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found that the term “sought to acquire” was ambiguous and that the alien might also satisfy the provision “by showing that there are extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond their control.” [1] However, neither Matter of O. Vasquez nor other authorities address how to treat the visa availability periods of less than 1 year that coincide with an alien’s period of extraordinary circumstances for purposes of INA 203(h) . In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, USCIS provides the applicant with another 1-year period to seek to acquire when the visa next becomes available again solely to ensure that the applicant has the benefit of the entire 1-year period afforded by Congress under INA 203(h) [2] Once the visa next becomes available, the applicant’s Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) age is calculated based on this next visa availability date. [3] USCIS has not previously issued policy guidance regarding extraordinary circumstances and the unavailability of a visa. In accordance with Matter of O. Vazquez, if the applicant establishes that extraordinary circumstances prevented the potential applicant from timely filing an adjustment of status application or otherwise seeking to acquire LPR status when a visa is available for less than a year, then it is reasonable for the agency to find that the applicant satisfied the sought to acquire provision during that period. Because USCIS had not previously addressed the issue of extraordinary circumstances and failure to seek to acquire prior to unavailability, the foregoing policy is new guidance. Accordingly, USCIS is supplementing its interpretation here. If USCIS were to account for extraordinary circumstances only during periods when the visa was available for a continuous 1-year period, but not during periods when the visa was available for less than 1 year, then USCIS would have to use the next visa availability date for purposes of an age calculation. [4] This would be the case even though it was beyond the control of the applicant to file earlier because of extraordinary circumstances. USCIS believes such an interpretation of the sought to acquire requirement, considering the statutory scheme limiting visa availability and the potential for visa retrogression in preference cases, does not comport with the interpretation of “sought to acquire” as provided in the BIA’s decision in Matter of O. Vazquez By issuing this guidance, USCIS is clarifying the interplay between the statutory scheme governing visa limitations and the BIA’s interpretation of “sought to acquire.” Through this guidance, USCIS provides new, clear instructions and ensures a uniform approach within the agency. The updated guidance, moreover, is consistent with the purpose of the CSPA, to protect certain beneficiaries from losing eligibility for immigrant visas due to aging out. USCIS also has considered the extent to which this policy update may adversely impact interested parties or upset reliance interests. Given that the guidance is a product of an interplay between statutory provisions governing visa limitation and binding BIA precedent, and the fact that USCIS previously did not have any guidance on the issue of a visa becoming unavailable during the first year of availability, the existence of extraordinary circumstances during the initial period of availability, and failure to seek to acquire during the initial period of availability, USCIS believes interested parties will have only developed serious reliance interests, if at all, based on the holding of Matter of O. Vazquez USCIS recognizes that given the visa allocation scheme provided by Congress, this new policy guidance means that some aliens may be eligible for CSPA benefits because they will be considered a child based on an earlier visa availability date, which in turn may cause other visa applicants to wait longer for an available visa. However, the current statutory scheme which permits certain individuals to be considered children for immigration purposes already results in other aliens having to wait longer for a visa to become available. Given that the updated guidance aims to ensures a uniform interpretation of law and provide guidance in an area that has not been expressly addressed, the implications of this guidance are generally likely to adversely affect the same proportion of individuals as those impacted by USCIS’ current implementation of CSPA. USCIS considers this impact to be outweighed by the benefits of avoiding family separation so that eligible aliens may adjust status with their parents. For these reasons, USCIS believes that, if there are any, reliance interests do not outweigh the benefits provided by this updated guidance. Therefore, USCIS believes that Matter of O. Vazquez is best implemented by considering an applicant to satisfy the sought to acquire provision when the visa is available for less than 1 year if the alien did not apply during that period but the", "metadata": {"id": "205b20b70a09b6b4", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-a", "title": "Part A - Adjustment of Status Policies and Procedures | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "205b20b70a09b6b4-1"}}

[1] Previously, USCIS issued policy guidance on February 14, 2023, that considered an immigrant visa available for CSPA age calculation at the same time USCIS considered a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application. [2] For purposes of determining visa availability, USCIS consults the DOS Visa Bulletin. [3] Until October 2015, DOS published only one chart in the Visa Bulletin that allowed USCIS officers to assess when a visa was available for allocation and issuance. That Visa Bulletin chart in effect corresponded to what is currently the “Final Action Dates” chart. In October 2015, DOS began publishing two charts in the DOS Visa Bulletin consisting of a “Dates for Filing” chart (which notifies beneficiaries when they may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center (NVC)) and a Final Action Dates chart (which informs when a visa is authorized for issuance). Between the enactment of the CSPA in 2002 and October 2015, it was understood that an immigrant visa “bec[ame] available” for the CSPA age calculation based on the chart published in the Visa Bulletin now known as the Final Action Dates chart. On May 23, 2018, following the publication of the two charts in the Visa Bulletin, USCIS issued policy guidance clarifying that it continued to only consider a visa available for the CSPA age calculation based on the Final Action Dates chart. [4] On February 14, 2023, USCIS issued updated policy guidance that a visa becomes available to calculate CSPA age for an alien at the same time USCIS considers a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application. [5] When USCIS determined there were more immigrant visas available for a fiscal year than there were known aliens for such visas, and USCIS designated the Dates for Filing chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin [6] to determine eligibility for filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Dates for Filing chart when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. When USCIS designated the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin for use by aliens when filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Final Action Dates when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. [7] Neither CSPA nor DHS regulations define when a visa becomes available for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under INA 203(h) , and there are no precedent federal court decisions or published administrative decisions on this issue.

[7] Neither CSPA nor DHS regulations define when a visa becomes available for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under INA 203(h) , and there are no precedent federal court decisions or published administrative decisions on this issue. USCIS carefully considered the February 14, 2023 interpretation of INA 203(h) , including in light of the Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo Loper Bright [8] USCIS believes that utilizing the Final Action Date is the most faithful alignment with the statutory text of INA 203(h) [9] and the structure of INA 203 as a whole, [10] and effectuates the purpose of INA 203(h) as recognized by courts. [11] Contrasted with INA 201(f)(1) , which broadly freezes the age of certain immediate relatives on the date of filing the immigrant petition, INA 203(h)(1) permits only certain preference aliens to be deemed a child for immigration purposes based on a particular formula which, when enacted, was centered around when a visa could actually be allocated and used for adjustment of status or immigrant visa processing. For adjustment cases, the application of the provisions of INA 203(h) is generally a retrospective analysis conducted at the time of final adjustment adjudication alone as opposed to eligibility to file under INA 245(a) Furthermore, using the Final Action Date chart is most consistent with the longstanding interpretation of INA 203(h) that USCIS had relied on prior to February 14, 2023, and is closest to the contemporaneous understanding of visa availability at the time Congress enacted CSPA. Interpretations issued contemporaneously with the statute, and which have remained consistent over time, are especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning. [12] When Congress enacted CSPA, it did so with the knowledge and understanding of existing law and processes provided by the agencies within their authorities and expertise, including the operation of the DOS Visa Bulletin. [13] DOS and USCIS utilized the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under INA 203(h) until the February 14, 2023 policy change, and this interpretation had remained consistent for over 20 years. Finally, by returning to the Final Action Dates chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation, [14] DHS ensures a uniform interpretation of INA 203(h) across government agencies and establishes parity for CSPA age calculations for aliens who apply for adjustment of status with USCIS and immigrant visas with DOS. After the February 14, 2023 policy update, USCIS and DOS interpreted INA 203(h) inconsistently, which resulted in inconsistent treatment of aliens who applied for adjustment of status in the United States and aliens who applied for an immigrant visa with DOS abroad. Even after implementing the October 2015 changes to the Visa Bulletin, DOS considered the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin as the only dates that should be used to calculate the CSPA age for aliens who apply for an immigrant visa. [15] Therefore, an alien filing for adjustment of status in the United States may have been considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA when USCIS designates the earlier dates in the Dates for Filing chart while an alien who must apply for an immigrant visa outside the United States may have been ineligible to immigrate as a child if his or her calculated CSPA age is 21 or older when a visa became available according to the later dates in the Final Action Dates chart. [16] USCIS is cognizant that the February 14, 2023 policy may have engendered reliance interests, and USCIS has assessed the impact of this policy change on aliens, including aliens with a pending adjustment of status application. This policy change means that the alien could have a visa immediately available for purposes of filing the adjustment of status application while a visa may not have become available under the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA calculation, if USCIS designates the Dates of Filing chart for purposes of filing adjustment of status applications in a given month. In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he or she would be considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA and, thus, whether the alien would be eligible for adjustment of status application once a visa is available to calculate his or her CSPA age. That was one of the triggering reasons for the February 14, 2023 policy. However, as explained, the February", "metadata": {"id": "205b20b70a09b6b4", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-a", "title": "Part A - Adjustment of Status Policies and Procedures | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "205b20b70a09b6b4-3"}}

In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he or she would be considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA and, thus, whether the alien would be eligible for adjustment of status application once a visa is available to calculate his or her CSPA age. That was one of the triggering reasons for the February 14, 2023 policy. However, as explained, the February 14, 2023 policy has neither been longstanding nor are these considerations of such nature that they would be engendering significant reliance interests for aliens who are impacted by the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, specifically, aliens who have not yet filed adjustment of status applications. [17] Every alien filing a request with USCIS assumes the risk that he or she may be ineligible for the benefit under U.S. immigration laws, and thus, may have paid a USCIS fee without obtaining the benefit. Aliens seeking eligibility to adjust status believing that they are considered a child under CSPA are no different. The short duration of the policy, and the lack of associated rights related to the February 14, 2023 guidance for aliens who file adjustment of status applications after the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, the fact that such aliens have not paid a fee for an adjustment of status application, and the absence of any guarantee that the alien would be eligible to remain a child under INA 203(h) or that the application for adjustment of status will be approved as a matter of discretion dilutes the strength of the alien’s reliance on the past practice. [18] Thus, while USCIS is always cognizant of any reliance interests no matter how small, USCIS believes that, for the reasons outlined in the policy guidance, the policy concerns addressed with this update outweigh the alien’s concerns that prompted the February 14, 2023 policy. [19] To address reliance interests of those aliens who have already filed adjustment of status applications, USCIS determined that it will apply this policy change prospectively only to applications filed on or after August 15, 2025. USCIS continues to apply the February 14, 2023 policy to aliens whose adjustment of status application are pending with USCIS before August 15, 2025. Moreover, if an alien demonstrates extraordinary circumstances for not applying for adjustment of status during the period of the former policy between February 14, 2023 and August 14, 2025 where a visa was available for CSPA age calculations at the same time a visa was immediately available for an alien to apply for adjustment of status under the February 14, 2023 policy, USCIS calculates the alien’s age under that former policy.

[^ 9] At least one court has addressed the meaning of when an immigrant visa “becomes available” under INA 203(h) . In Lin Liu v. Smith, 515 F. Supp. 3d 193, 197 (S.D.N.Y. 2021), the court determined that the ordinary meaning of the term “available” under INA 203(h) meant that “a visa number cannot be considered available until it can be issued legally,” and thus, found that DOS was correct to tether availability for purposes of INA 203(h) to the Final Action Dates chart. The holding in this District court decision does not have precedential value and is not binding on USCIS, see, for example, Matter of Rosales Vargas , 27 I&N Dec. 745, 749 n.7 (BIA 2020); nevertheless, USCIS believes that the reasoning contained in this decision is persuasive in the context of “becomes available” under INA 203(h) [^ 10] Congress embedded INA 203(h) within INA 203 , which addresses the allocation of immigrant visas generally. In this section, Congress authorized DOS to administer the visa quota system consistent with numerical limitations imposed by Congress.

In this section, Congress authorized DOS to administer the visa quota system consistent with numerical limitations imposed by Congress. See INA 203(e)-(g) . The statute authorizes DOS to make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued and to rely on those numbers when authorizing the issuance of immigrant visas. See INA 203(e)-(g) . See 22 CFR 42.51 and 22 CFR 42.54 . The availability of an immigrant visa under INA 203(h) is thus closely tied to DOS’ allocation of immigrant visa numbers for the issuance of immigrant visas, for which DOS uses the Final Action Dates chart. See INA 245(b) (upon approval of an adjustment of status application under INA 245(a) , DOS reduces the number of corresponding visas authorized for issuance under INA 202 and INA 203 by one within the class to which the alien is chargeable for the fiscal year then current). [^ 11] In analyzing the statute’s plain language and structure, as well as Congress’ contemporaneous understanding of immigration law at the time of the CSPA’s enactment, courts have recognized that Congress only intended the CSPA to address children aging out because of delays in the adjudication of immigrant petitions, not because of delays due to statutory limits on visa allocations. For example, see Scialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio , 573 U.S. 41, 53 (2014) (plurality op.) (“But the time in between—the months or, more likely, years the alien spends simply waiting for a visa to become available—is not similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the immigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions, can still ‘age out’ . . . prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.”). Using the Final Action Dates chart is more consistent with this purpose because it only mitigates the consequences of the administrative delays, but not any additional time spent waiting before DOS can authorize a visa number for issuance. [^ 12] See Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (PDF) 603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024). [^ 13] For example, see H.R. Rep. 107-45 , p. 2, 2002 U.S.C.C.A.N. 640, 641(2001) (describing the mechanics of immigrant visa availability and the associated waiting list). [^ 14] As it is the case with all USCIS Policy Manual guidance, this update to current USCIS policy guidance is based on USCIS’ interpretation of the applicable terms in the INA and the necessary policies and procedures to implement them. An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue interpretive rules, general statements of policy or rules of agency organization and procedure or practice. See 5 U.S.C. 553 . Additionally, this policy guidance relates to the efforts of USCIS to control the status, exit, and entry of aliens, which constitutes a foreign affairs function under the APA.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose Lawful permanent resident (LPR) status confers several significant privileges, rights, and responsibilities [1] that invoke a commitment to greater assimilation in the United States and offers a pathway to U.S. citizenship. These privileges, rights, and responsibilities include: Living permanently in the United States, provided the LPR does not commit any actions that would make the LPR removable under immigration law; Working in the United States in any legal capacity of the LPR’s qualification and choosing; Being protected by all laws of the United States, including state of residence and local jurisdictions; Obeying all laws of the United States and localities; Filing income tax returns and reporting income to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities; Supporting the democratic form of government of the United States; [2] Registering with the Selective Service, if male and age 18 through 25; Petitioning for a spouse, unmarried children, and unmarried son(s) or daughter(s) to receive permanent residence; and Applying for U.S. citizenship once eligible. There are two general paths to LPR status. Aliens who are outside of the United States and who are beneficiaries of approved immigrant petitions can apply for an immigrant visa at an overseas consular office of the U.S. Department of State. Once issued an immigrant visa, if an alien is found admissible, he or she may be admitted into the United States as an LPR. Aliens who are present in the United States and who are beneficiaries of approved immigrant petitions may generally file an application with USCIS to adjust their status to that of an LPR, or they may depart the United States and apply for an immigrant visa abroad. One reason Congress created the adjustment of status provision was to enable certain aliens physically present in the United States to become LPRs without incurring the expense and inconvenience of traveling abroad to obtain an immigrant visa. Congress has added additional adjustment of status provisions to: Ensure national security and public safety; Advance economic growth and a robust immigrant labor force; Promote family unity; and Accommodate humanitarian resettlement. B. Background Adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence describes the process by which an alien obtains U.S. LPR status while physically present in the United States. USCIS issues a permanent resident card (Form I-551) (commonly called a green card) to the successful adjustment applicant as proof of such immigrant status. Most adjustment of status approvals are granted based on family or employment relationships. Unlike immigrant visa petition processing where the focus is on the relationship between the petitioner and beneficiary, the focus on an adjustment application is on the applicant’s eligibility and admissibility. The following overview provides a brief history of permanent immigration and adjustment of status, along with a summary of major developments in U.S. immigration law over the years. 1. Early Immigration Laws Prior to the late 19th century, immigration was essentially unregulated. At that time, Congress imposed the first qualitative restrictions, which barred certain undesirable immigrants such as criminals and those with infectious diseases from entering the country. During the 1920s, Congress established annual quotas that imposed the first numerical restrictions on immigration. This was known as the National Origins Quota System. The system limited immigration from each country to a designated percentage of foreign-born persons of that nationality who resided in the United States according to the 1910 census. These quotas did not apply to spouses and children (unmarried and under 21 years old) of U.S. citizens. [3] These immigration laws required all intending immigrants to obtain an immigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad and then travel to the United States and seek admission as LPRs. [4] As such, these laws provided no legal procedure by which an alien already physically present in the United States could become a permanent resident without first leaving the country to obtain the required immigrant visa. By 1935, the administrative process of pre-examination was developed so that an alien already temporarily in the United States could obtain permanent resident status more quickly and easily. [5] In general, the pre-examination process consisted of an official determination in the United States of the alien’s immigrant visa eligibility, followed by a trip to Canada or another country for an arranged immigrant visa appointment at a U.S. consulate, and a prompt return and admission to the United States as a permanent resident. The government processed over 45,000 pre-examination cases from 1935 to 1950. [6] Near the onset of World War II, the U.S. government became increasingly concerned about the possibility of hostile foreign enemies living in the United States. In response, Congress enacted the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which required foreign-born persons 14 years of age and older to report to a U.S. post office, and later to an immigration", "metadata": {"id": "7b472e56efe8c24d", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-a-chapter-1", "title": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "7b472e56efe8c24d-0"}}

[6] Near the onset of World War II, the U.S. government became increasingly concerned about the possibility of hostile foreign enemies living in the United States. In response, Congress enacted the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which required foreign-born persons 14 years of age and older to report to a U.S. post office, and later to an immigration office, to be fingerprinted and register their presence in the United States. [7] Those found to have no legal basis to remain in the United States were required to leave or were removed. Those with a valid claim to permanent residency received an Alien Registration Card. 2. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 The passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952 organized all existing immigration laws into one consolidated source. [8] The INA retained a modified system of both qualitative and numerical restrictions on permanent immigration. The INA established a revised version of the controversial National Origins Quota System, limiting immigration from the eastern hemisphere while leaving immigration from the western hemisphere unrestricted. The INA also introduced a system of numerically limited immigrant preference categories, some based on desirable job skills and others based on family reunification. Spouses and children (unmarried and under 21 years old) of U.S. citizens remained exempt from any quota restrictions. In addition, the INA established a formal system of temporary (or nonimmigrant) categories under which aliens could come to the United States for various temporary purposes such as to visit, study, or work. For the first time, the INA also provided a procedure for aliens temporarily in the United States to adjust status to permanent resident status without having to travel abroad and undergo consular processing. Although it has since been amended many times, the INA remains the foundation of current immigration law in the United States. 3. Post-1952 Developments Congress amended the INA in 1965 to abolish the National Origins Quota System, creating in its place separate quotas for immigration from the eastern and western hemispheres. [9] These amendments also established a revised preference system of six categories for family-based and employment-based categories, and added a seventh preference category for refugees. Finally, the law introduced an initial version of what has evolved into today’s permanent labor certification program. Further amendments in 1976 and 1978 ultimately combined the eastern and western hemisphere quotas into a single worldwide quota system which limited annual immigration from any single country to 20,000 and established an overall limit of 290,000 immigrants per year. [10] The Refugee Act of 1980 established a separate immigration program for refugees, eliminating the existing seventh preference category, and formally adopted the legal definition of “refugee” used by the United Nations. [11] The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 provided a pathway for obtaining permanent resident status to certain agricultural workers and aliens who had been continuously present in the United States since before January 1, 1982. [12] IRCA also increased immigration enforcement at U.S. borders and established a program which, for the first time in history, required U.S. employers to verify all newly hired employees’ work authorization in the United States. This is sometimes called the employer sanctions program or the I-9 program. Congress next enacted the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 (IMFA) with the goal of deterring immigration-related marriage fraud. [13] IMFA’s key provision stipulated that aliens who obtain immigrant status based on a marriage existing for less than 2 years be granted lawful permanent residence initially on a conditional basis. This conditional status may be converted to full permanent resident status after 2 years, generally upon a showing that the conditional resident and his or her U.S. citizen spouse entered into the marriage in good faith and continued to share a life together. 4. Immigration Act of 1990 Congress made the most sweeping changes to the original INA by passing the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT 90). [14] Key provisions adopted by IMMACT 90 include: Significantly increased the worldwide quota limits on permanent immigration from 290,000 to 675,000 per year (plus up to another 125,000 for refugees); Established separate preference categories for family-based and employment-based immigration, including moving several special immigrant categories into the employment-based preferences and adding a new category for immigrant investors; Established the Diversity Visa Program, making immigrant visas available to randomly selected aliens coming from countries with historically low rates of immigration; Created several new nonimmigrant work visa categories: O, P, Q,", "metadata": {"id": "7b472e56efe8c24d", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-a-chapter-1", "title": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "7b472e56efe8c24d-1"}}

Congress continued to refine the U.S. immigration system by enacting two laws in 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act [15] and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), [16] which in part were intended to improve border control, expand worksite enforcement of the employer sanctions program, and enhance removal of criminal and other deportable aliens. These laws also introduced the concept of unlawful presence as an exclusion ground, expanded the definition of aggravated felon, and eliminated or greatly restricted the scope of judicial review involving certain administrative actions and decisions by U.S. immigration authorities. 5. Other Adjustment of Status Provisions Over the years, Congress has created several adjustment programs otherwise different from general adjustment that apply to relatively small numbers of aliens who meet highly particularized criteria. Most of these programs are found in laws that are not part of the INA. C.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements A. Who Is Eligible to Adjust Status The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and certain other federal laws provide over forty different ways for aliens to adjust status to lawful permanent residence. Aliens may only adjust under a particular basis if they meet the eligibility requirements for that basis at the time of filing the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( Form I-485 ). Eligibility requirements vary, depending on the specific basis for adjustment. [1] Immigrant Categories Aliens eligible for adjustment of status generally may apply based on one of the following immigrant categories or basis for adjustment: Immediate relative of a U.S. citizen; [2] Other relative of a U.S. citizen or relative of a lawful permanent resident under a family-based preference category; [3] Person admitted to the United States as a fiancé(e) of a U.S. citizen; Widow(er) of a U.S. citizen; Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioner; Alien worker under an employment-based preference category; [4] Alien investor; Special immigrant; [5] Human trafficking victim; Crime victim; Alien granted asylum status; Alien granted refugee status; Person qualifying under certain special programs based on certain public laws; [6] Diversity Visa program; Private immigration bill signed into law; Other eligibility under a special program not listed above (for example, Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) [7] Section 202); Adjustment of status under INA 245(i) ; or Derivative applicant (filing based on a principal applicant). Specific eligibility requirements for each immigrant category are discussed in the program-specific parts of this volume. B. Who is Not Eligible to Adjust Status Aliens are generally not eligible for adjustment of status if one or more of the following bars to adjustment or grounds of inadmissibility apply. However, adjustment bars do not apply to every type of adjustment pathway. Furthermore, different inadmissibility grounds may apply to different adjustment pathways. Therefore, applicants may still be able to adjust under certain immigrant categories due to special exceptions or exemptions from the adjustment bars, inadmissibility grounds, or access to program-specific waivers of inadmissibility or other forms of relief. 1. Bars to Adjustment Depending on how an alien entered the United States or if an alien committed a particular act or violation of immigration law, he or she may be barred from adjusting status. With certain exceptions, some aliens ineligible for adjustment of status under INA 245 include any alien who: [8] Last entered the United States without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer; [9] Last entered the United States as a nonimmigrant crewman; [10] Is now employed or has ever been employed in the United States without authorization; [11] Is not in lawful immigration status on the date of filing his or her application; [12] Has ever failed to continuously maintain a lawful status since entry into the United States, unless his or her failure to maintain status was through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons; [13] Was last admitted to the United States in transit without a visa; [14] Was last admitted to Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) as a visitor under the Guam or CNMI Visa Waiver Program and who is not a Canadian citizen; [15] Was last admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor without a visa under the Visa Waiver Program; [16] Is deportable due to involvement in a terrorist activity or group; [17] Is seeking employment-based adjustment of status and who is not maintaining a lawful nonimmigrant status on the date of filing this application; [18] Has ever violated the terms of his or her nonimmigrant status; [19] ​Is a conditional permanent resident; [20] and Was admitted as a nonimmigrant fiancé(e), but did not marry the U.S. citizen who filed the petition or any alien who was admitted as the nonimmigrant child of a fiancé(e) whose parent did not marry the U.S. citizen who filed the petition. [21] 2. Grounds of Inadmissibility Generally, an adjustment applicant is inadmissible to the United States and ineligible for adjustment of status if one or more of the grounds of inadmissibility apply to him or her. [22] However, if the adjustment applicant is eligible for and is granted a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility or another form of relief, the applicant may remain eligible for adjustment. [23] 3. Other Eligibility Requirements Government Officials and Specialty Workers Foreign government officials, representatives to international organizations, treaty traders and treaty investors (A, E, and G nonimmigrants) may have certain rights, privileges, immunities and exemptions not granted to other nonimmigrants. If such a nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status, he or she must waive those rights, privileges, immunities and exemptions by filing a waiver application (Request for Waiver of Certain Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities ( Form I-508", "metadata": {"id": "81bd5f4dd6ece9ee", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-a-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "81bd5f4dd6ece9ee-0"}}

Other Eligibility Requirements Government Officials and Specialty Workers Foreign government officials, representatives to international organizations, treaty traders and treaty investors (A, E, and G nonimmigrants) may have certain rights, privileges, immunities and exemptions not granted to other nonimmigrants. If such a nonimmigrant seeks adjustment of status, he or she must waive those rights, privileges, immunities and exemptions by filing a waiver application (Request for Waiver of Certain Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities ( Form I-508 An Australian specialty occupation worker (E-3 nonimmigrant) has no special rights, privileges, immunities or exemptions to waive and therefore is not required to submit the waiver. Although these workers can be classified as a treaty trader, [24] the waiver requirement was established prior to the creation of the Australian specialty occupation worker classification. In addition, any applicant admitted in an A, G, or NATO nonimmigrant status must file an Interagency Record of Request – A, G or NATO Dependent Employment Authorization or Change/Adjustment to/from A, G or NATO Status ( Form I-566 ) with the Department of State. Forms I-508 and I-566 may be concurrently filed with the adjustment application. Certain Exchange Visitors [25] Certain exchange visitors (J-1 and J-2 nonimmigrants) [26] admitted to the United States are subject to a 2-year foreign residence requirement. [27] These exchange visitors generally must reside and be physically present in the country of their last residence or the country of their nationality for a cumulative total period (in the aggregate) of at least 2 years after the end of their exchange program and after leaving the United States before they can apply for permanent residence. If such exchange visitors do not return to the country of their last residence or country of nationality for at least 2 years, in the aggregate, after the end of their exchange program, they may be ineligible for adjustment of status. However, certain exchange visitors may be eligible for a waiver of the requirement through an Application for Waiver of the Foreign Residence Requirement ( Form I-612 [28] Officers should first adjudicate the waiver request, as denial of the waiver necessarily renders the applicant ineligible for adjustment of status. Officers should not hold adjustment cases while waiting for either the applicant to submit a waiver application or the Department of State to make a recommendation on a waiver application and instead should deny the adjustment application for ineligibility based on the evidence of record.

{"text": "Chapter 3 - Filing Instructions A. Form Instructions An alien typically applies for adjustment of status using the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( Form I-485 ). An applicant must file the adjustment application according to the instructions and regulations in existence at the time of filing. The form instructions have the same force as a regulation and provide detailed information an applicant must follow. [1] Therefore, an applicant should access the most recent version of the form on USCIS.gov prior to filing. B. Definition of Properly Filed An applicant must properly file the adjustment application. Properly filed refers to an adjustment application filed: At the correct filing location with the correct filing fees, unless granted a waiver; [2] With the proper signature of the applicant; and When an immigrant visa is immediately available. [3] If the application is filed without meeting these requirements, USCIS rejects and returns the application. The application is not considered properly filed until it has been given a receipt date (stamped to show the actual date of receipt) by the proper location with jurisdiction over the application, including a USCIS Lockbox. Applications that are rejected and returned to the applicant do not retain a filing date. [4] 1. Filing Location The filing location for an adjustment application is based on the filing category of the applicant. An applicant must verify the filing location by accessing current instructions on USCIS.gov prior to filing. USCIS may relocate an application filed at the wrong location at its discretion or reject the application for improper filing. 2. Signature Requirements All applications must be properly signed by the applicant. [5] Acceptable and Unacceptable Signatures Acceptable Unacceptable Original signature Handwritten “X,” or similar mark, in ink (including a fingerprint, if unable to write) Abbreviated signature, if that is the normal signature Signature of parent or legal guardian of benefit requestor if requestor is under 14 years of age Signature by the benefit requestor’s legal guardian, surrogate, or person with a valid durable power of attorney or similar legally binding document [6] An original signature on the benefit request that is later photocopied, scanned, faxed, or similarly reproduced, unless otherwise required by form instructions Electronic signature [7] Typed name on signature line Signature by an attorney or representative signing for the requestor or requestor's child Signature created by a typewriter, word processor, stamp, auto-pen, or similar device [8] 3. Visa Availability Requirement Generally, aliens seeking adjustment under INA 245(a) may only file an adjustment application when an immigrant visa number is available in the classification under which they qualify. [9] Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are not subject to numerical limitations. Therefore, an immigrant visa is always immediately available to immediate relatives at the time they file an adjustment application. In contrast, applicants seeking adjustment under an employment-based or family-based preference category must generally wait until a visa is immediately available before they may file their adjustment application. [10] These applicants can determine if a visa is available and when to file their adjustment application by referring to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) Visa Bulletin A new Visa Bulletin is published on a monthly basis. DOS posts two charts per visa preference category in each month’s DOS Visa Bulletin: Application Final Action Dates chart, which provides dates when visas may finally be issued; and ​Dates for Filing Applications chart, which provides the earliest dates when applicants may be able to apply. In general, adjustment applicants must use the Application Final Action Dates chart to determine whether a visa is available. However, if USCIS determines there are immigrant visas available for the filing of additional adjustment applications, the Dates for Filing Applications chart may be used to determine when to file an adjustment of status application with USCIS. [11] USCIS and DOS provide information on which chart should be used in a particular month on the Adjustment of Status Filing Charts from the Visa Bulletin webpage and DOS Visa Bulletin C. Concurrent Filings [12] In general, the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition may file for adjustment of status only after USCIS has approved the petition and a visa is available. In certain instances, the beneficiary may file an adjustment application together or concurrently with the underlying immigrant petition. Concurrent filing of the adjustment application is possible only where approval of the underlying immigrant petition would make a visa number immediately available. Concurrent filing of the adjustment application is permitted in the following immigrant categories: Family-based immigrants, including immediate relatives, and widow(er)s of a U.S. citizen; Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioner; Employment-based immigrants in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th preference categories; Special immigrant Amerasians; Special immigrant juveniles; G-4 international organization employees, NATO-6 employees, and certain family members; and Certain members of the U.S. armed forces.

D. Jurisdiction USCIS has the legal authority to adjudicate most adjustment of status cases, including applications by aliens who have been placed in deportation or removal proceedings as “arriving aliens.” [13] An immigration judge (IJ) of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has jurisdiction in all other cases where an applicant is in removal proceedings, even if the proceedings have been administratively closed or if there is a final order of deportation or removal which has not yet been executed. [14] As an exception to the general rule regarding “arriving aliens,” the IJ also has jurisdiction over an application filed by an alien who has been placed in deportation or removal proceedings as an “arriving alien” when all of the following conditions apply: The adjustment application was properly filed with USCIS while the applicant was in the United States; The applicant departed from and returned to the United States based on a grant of an advance parole document to pursue the previously filed adjustment application; USCIS denied the adjustment application; DHS placed the applicant in removal proceedings as an “arriving alien” either upon return to the United States on the advance parole document or after USCIS denied the adjustment application; and The applicant is seeking to renew the previously denied application for adjustment of status in proceedings. [15] The IJ has jurisdiction only with respect to the application filed before the applicant left with the advance parole document. If the applicant is pursuing a new application for adjustment of status based on a new ground such as a new petition, the IJ does not have jurisdiction over the new claim. USCIS has jurisdiction over the application, even if the applicant was placed in proceedings after having been paroled into the United States to pursue a previously filed application for adjustment of status that was ultimately denied by USCIS. USCIS has jurisdiction to adjudicate an adjustment application when the IJ does not have jurisdiction, including when an alien placed in removal proceedings as an “arriving alien” does not meet all of the above criteria. [16] USCIS continues to retain jurisdiction over such an alien’s adjustment application even if the alien has an unexecuted final order of removal. [17] A removal order is considered executed once immigration authorities remove the alien from the United States or the alien departs from the United States. [18] Effect of Departure In general, adjustment applicants who depart the United States abandon their applications unless USCIS previously granted them advance parole for such absences. [19] However, USCIS does not consider a TPS beneficiary to have abandoned the adjustment application if the beneficiary travels with authorization under INA 244(f)(3) and, upon returning to the United States, is admitted into TPS under the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991.

To determine visa availability, USCIS compares the number of visas available for the remainder of the fiscal year with documentarily qualified visa applications reported by DOS; pending adjustment of status applications reported by USCIS; and historical drop-off rate of applicants for adjustment of status (for example, denials, withdrawals, and abandonments). [^ 12] See 8 CFR 245.2(a)(2)(i)(B) and 8 CFR 245.2(a)(2)(i)(C) [^ 13] See 8 CFR 245.2(a)(1) . See 8 CFR 1245.2(a)(1) . See 8 CFR 1.2 for definition of an “arriving alien.” [^ 14] A temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiary who obtains USCIS’ authorization to travel abroad temporarily (as evidenced by a travel authorization document issued under 8 CFR 244.15(a) ) must be admitted into TPS upon return to the United States in accordance with such authorization, unless DHS determines the beneficiary is inadmissible based on certain criminal and security bars (TPS bars) listed in INA 244(c)(2)(A)(iii) . See Section 304(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), Pub. L. 102-232 (PDF) , 105 Stat. 1733, 1749 (December 12, 1991), as amended. A TPS beneficiary in pending removal proceedings at the time of departure remains a TPS beneficiary in removal proceedings upon authorized reentry into the United States under MTINA, unless those proceedings have been otherwise terminated. See Section 304(c)(1)(A)(ii) of MTINA, Pub. L. 102-232 (PDF) , 105 Stat. 1733, 1749 (December 12, 1991), as amended. See Duarte v. Mayorkas , 27 F.4th 1044 (5th Cir. 2022). The TPS-authorized travel does not, itself, change whether or not the beneficiary has been placed in proceedings “as an arriving alien,” and therefore does not affect jurisdiction over the adjustment application. However, a TPS beneficiary who met the definition of an “arriving alien” at the time of departure on authorized travel would no longer be an arriving alien if DHS admits the TPS beneficiary into TPS under MTINA upon return. See 8 CFR 1.2 . See Duarte v. Mayorkas , 27 F.4th 1044 (5th Cir. 2022). Consequently, if DHS places the beneficiary into removal proceedings after returning from authorized travel, USCIS would not have jurisdiction over the adjustment application. [^ 15] See 8 CFR 1245.2(a)(1)(ii) [^ 16] See 8 CFR 245.2(a)(1) [^ 17] See Matter of Yauri (PDF) , 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009). [^ 18] See INA 101(g) . However, in the case of a TPS beneficiary with an outstanding final removal order, travel abroad does not execute the removal order if the beneficiary received prior authorization to travel under INA 244(f)(3) and DHS admitted the beneficiary into TPS under MTINA upon return to the United States. See Duarte v. Mayorkas , 27 F.4th 1044 (5th Cir. 2022). [^ 19] See 8 CFR 245.2(a)(4)(ii) . In certain circumstances, a departure does not cause abandonment of the adjustment application. See 8 CFR 245.2(a)(4)(ii)(B)-(D) [^ 20] See Section 304(c)(1)(A)(ii) of MTINA, Pub. L. 102-232 (PDF) , 105 Stat. 1733, 1749 (December 12, 1991).

{"text": "Chapter 4 - Documentation A Record of Proceeding (ROP) is created when an adjustment application is received. While not every ROP contains the same exact information or documents, all ROPs are created in the same format and documents are placed in the file from top to bottom. A. Initial Evidence When reviewing an adjustment of status application, the officer must verify that the following evidence is contained in the A-file and is placed in ROP order on the left side of the file. 1. Photographs Two passport-style photographs must be included. The photographs must be: 2” x 2” in color with full face, frontal view; On a white to off-white background, printed on thin paper with a glossy finish; and Be un-mounted and un-retouched. The photographs must have been taken within 30 days of filing. [1] 2. Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485) Aliens apply for permanent resident status by filing Form I-485 at the appropriate time with the correct fee and necessary documentation to establish eligibility. 3. Birth Certificate A copy of the applicant’s foreign birth certificate or sufficient secondary evidence of birth must be submitted to establish the applicant’s country of citizenship for visa chargeability, identity, and existence of derivative relationships. [2] Each foreign birth certificate must include a certified English translation. [3] Officers should check the Department of State's Country Reciprocity Schedule to determine availability of birth certificates as well as acceptable secondary evidence of birth for specific countries. 4. Evidence of Admission or Parole In most cases, an adjustment applicant is required to provide evidence of inspection and admission or parole. [4] Typical documents that prove inspection and admission or parole include: Copy of the entry or parole stamps in the applicant’s passport issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94); Form I-94 issued by USCIS at the bottom of a Notice of Action (Form I-797); or Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-512 or I-512L). If an applicant appears at an interview with none of the above evidence but claims to have been “waved in” at the port of entry (POE), the applicant may still be considered to have been inspected and admitted in some cases. [5] The burden of proof is on the applicant to provide sufficient evidence to establish eligibility. [6] 5. Affidavit of Support and Related Forms (Form I-864, I-864A, and I-864EZ) An affidavit of support is required for most immediate relative and family-based immigrants. The affidavit of support is also required for any employment-based immigrant whose petitioner is the applicant’s spouse, parent, child, adult son or daughter, or sibling and in which the applicant’s family has 5% or more ownership in the business. The purpose of this form is to show the applicant has adequate means of financial support and is unlikely to become a public charge. [7] 6. Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (Form I-693) Form I-693 is required for adjustment of status applicants who either did not receive a medical examination prior to their admission to the United States or who do not have evidence of an overseas medical examination in their file. A medical examination and vaccination record must be documented for most adjustment of status applications and completed as closely as possible to submission of the adjustment application. [8] If not completed overseas, the medical examination must be completed by a designated civil surgeon in the United States and documented on this form. [9] 7. Certified Copies of Arrest Records and Court Dispositions All applicants that have previously been arrested are required to submit original or court-certified copies of the arrest records, court dispositions or both. If an applicant’s fingerprints reveal an arrest record, the applicant’s A-file should contain a Record of Arrest and Prosecution (RAP) sheet. If there is an arrest record, the applicant must submit an original or certified copy of the official arrest report or other statement by the arresting agency and official court records showing the disposition of all arrests, detentions, or convictions regardless of where in the world the arrest occurred. Applicants are not required to submit records for minor traffic violations, records that are not drug or alcohol-related, did not result in an arrest, or in which the only penalty was a fine of less than $500 or points on a driver’s license. 8. Evidence of Underlying Basis to Adjust Status [10] An officer should verify the immigrant category indicated on Form I-485 as the basis for adjustment. The applicant can attach: A copy of the Form I-797 Approval Notice for an approved underlying immigrant visa petition; The underlying immigrant visa petition together with the Form I-485, if concurrently filing; or A copy of the Form I-797 Receipt Notice for an underlying immigrant visa petition", "metadata": {"id": "db4a59cacb2126fd", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-a-chapter-4", "title": "Chapter 4 - Documentation | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "db4a59cacb2126fd-0"}}

Applicants are not required to submit records for minor traffic violations, records that are not drug or alcohol-related, did not result in an arrest, or in which the only penalty was a fine of less than $500 or points on a driver’s license. 8. Evidence of Underlying Basis to Adjust Status [10] An officer should verify the immigrant category indicated on Form I-485 as the basis for adjustment. The applicant can attach: A copy of the Form I-797 Approval Notice for an approved underlying immigrant visa petition; The underlying immigrant visa petition together with the Form I-485, if concurrently filing; or A copy of the Form I-797 Receipt Notice for an underlying immigrant visa petition that remains pending. Certain adjustment applicants, however, are not required to have an underlying petition. These applicants include: Asylees; Refugees; Applicants eligible for certain adjustment of status programs based on certain public laws; [11] Persons born under diplomatic status in the United States; [12] Persons applying for Creation of Record; and Applicants who obtain relief through a private immigration bill signed into law. In these cases, the officer should review any specific eligibility and evidentiary requirements that apply to the program or law to ensure the applicant is eligible to adjust on that basis. 9. Additional Evidence for Eligibility Additional evidence is required for certain applicants in order to meet specific eligibility requirements. For instance, an applicant may need to submit marriage certificates or divorce decrees to establish the required relationship for the classification. Additionally, applicants under most preference categories may need to submit evidence that they are not subject to any bars to adjustment as a result of failing to maintain their nonimmigrant status, working without authorization, or otherwise violating the terms of their nonimmigrant status. B. Unavailability of Records and the Use of Affidavits There are certain situations where an applicant may not be able to provide the required primary evidence but may be able to submit secondary evidence. When submitting secondary evidence, an applicant must establish that the required primary document is unavailable or does not exist. [13] 1. Establishing Required Primary Document Is Unavailable or Does Not Exist [14] To establish that a required primary document is unavailable or does not exist, an applicant must submit letters of certification of non-existence issued by the appropriate civil authority. These letters must: Be an original written statement from a civil authority on official government letterhead; Establish the nonexistence or unavailability of the document; Indicate the reason the record does not exist; and Indicate whether similar records for the time and place are available. Certification of non-existence from a civil authority is not required where the Department of State’s Reciprocity Schedule indicates this type of document generally does not exist. An officer should consult the Reciprocity Schedule before issuing a Request for Evidence (RFE) for a missing document that is required. If an applicant is unable to obtain a letter of certification of non-existence issued by the appropriate civil authority, the applicant or petitioner may submit evidence that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain the required documentation. 2. Secondary Evidence Once an applicant has demonstrated that a required primary document is unavailable, the applicant may submit appropriate secondary evidence, such as church or school records pertaining to the facts at issue. 3. Affidavits If an applicant has demonstrated unavailability of both a required primary and secondary document, the applicant must submit at least two affidavits, or sworn written statements, pertaining to the facts at issue. Such affidavits must be given by: Persons who are not parties to the underlying petition; and Persons who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances in question. [15] In order for an applicant to meet his or her burden of proof, the officer must examine the evidence for its probative value and credibility. For these reasons, an affidavit should include: The full name, address, and contact information of the affiant (person giving the sworn statement), including his or her own date and place of birth, and relationship (if any) to the applicant; A copy of the affiant’s government-issued identification, if available; Full information concerning the facts at issue; and An explanation of how the affiant has direct personal knowledge of the relevant events and circumstances. Affidavits that cannot be verified carry no weight in proving the facts at issue. Persons submitting affidavits may be relatives of the applicant and do not necessarily have to be U.S. citizens. [16] C. Requests for Evidence (RFE) An officer must review all documents submitted and contained within the applicant’s A-file to: Determine acceptability; Ensure all required documents are present; and Avoid issuing an RFE requesting information already available in the A-file. Requests for Evidence (RFE) Scenario Officer Action Any required initial evidence is incomplete,", "metadata": {"id": "db4a59cacb2126fd", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-a-chapter-4", "title": "Chapter 4 - Documentation | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "db4a59cacb2126fd-1"}}

Requests for Evidence (RFE) Scenario Officer Action Any required initial evidence is incomplete, missing, or raises eligibility concerns Prepare and issue an RFE to provide the applicant an opportunity to establish his or her eligibility; or Deny the application. [17] All required initial evidence is submitted, but the evidence submitted does not establish eligibility Prepare and issue an RFE for additional information; Prepare and issue a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) with the basis for the proposed denial and require the applicant to submit a response; or Deny the application for ineligibility. [18] A family member’s A-file contains a document required to establish eligibility Make a copy of the required document; Place the copy in the applicant’s A-file in the proper ROP order; and Return the original document to the family member’s A-file, in proper ROP order. Originals of applications and petitions must be submitted unless previously filed with USCIS. Documents typically submitted as originals with the adjustment application may include a concurrently filed petition, the medical examination report, and affidavits. An applicant only needs to submit original documents required by regulation or form instructions and necessary to support the application. An official original document issued by USCIS or by legacy INS does not need to be submitted, unless requested. Unless otherwise required by applicable regulations or form instructions, a legible photocopy of any other supporting document may be submitted. An officer, however, may request an original document if there is reason to question the authenticity of the document for which a photocopy has been submitted. If originals are requested to validate a photocopy, they should be returned to the applicant after review and verification unless regulations require the originals to be submitted and retained. Failure to submit a requested original document may result in denial or revocation of the underlying application or benefit. [19] An officer may check available systems to validate evidence submitted by the applicant, as well as to verify claimed entries, prior deportations, visa issuance, and criminal history.

{"text": "Chapter 5 - Interview Guidelines All adjustment of status applicants must be interviewed by an officer unless the interview is waived by USCIS. [1] The decision to waive the interview should be made on a case-by-case basis. The interview enables USCIS to verify important information about the applicant to determine eligibility for adjustment. For family-based applications, USCIS generally requires the Form I-130 petitioner to appear for the interview with the principal adjustment of status applicant. In addition, derivatives are also required to appear regardless of the filing category. During the interview, the officer verifies that the applicant understood the questions on the application and provides the applicant with an opportunity to revise any answers completed incorrectly or that have changed since filing the application. Any unanswered questions or incomplete answers on the application are resolved at the interview. If information is added or revised, the applicant should re-sign and date the application at the conclusion of the interview. [2] A. Waiving the Interview 1. General Waiver Categories USCIS officers may determine, on a case-by case-basis, that it is unnecessary to interview certain adjustment of status applicants. When determining whether to waive an interview, an officer must consider all relevant evidence in the applicant’s record. The following list includes, but is not limited to, categories of cases where officers may decide to waive an interview: [3] Applicants who are clearly ineligible; [4] Unmarried children (under 21 years of age) of U.S. citizens if they filed a Form I-485 on their own (or filed a Form I-485 together with their family’s adjustment applications and every applicant in that family is eligible for an interview waiver); Parents of U.S. citizens; and Unmarried children (under 14 years of age) of lawful permanent residents if they filed a Form I-485 on their own (or filed a Form I-485 together with their family’s adjustment applications and every applicant in that family is eligible for an interview waiver). If USCIS determines, however, that an interview for an applicant in any of the above categories is necessary, an officer conducts the interview. Likewise, if USCIS determines that an interview of an applicant in any other category not listed above is unnecessary, then USCIS may waive the interview. [5] 2. Military Personnel Petitioners USCIS may waive the personal appearance of the military spouse petitioner; however, the adjustment applicant must appear for an interview. USCIS makes every effort to reschedule these cases so that both the petitioner and adjustment applicant can attend the interview before deployment. The adjustment applicant may choose to proceed while the petitioner is abroad. 3. Incarcerated Petitioners USCIS may waive the personal appearance of a U.S. citizen spouse petitioner who is incarcerated and unable to attend the adjustment of status interview. In these situations, the adjustment applicant must appear for an interview. An officer must take all the facts and evidence surrounding each case into consideration on a case-by-case basis when deciding whether to waive the U.S. citizen spouse petitioner’s appearance. 4. Illness or Incapacitation An officer may encounter instances in which it may be appropriate to waive the personal appearance of an applicant or petitioner due to illness or incapacitation. In all such instances, an officer must obtain supervisory approval to waive the interview. B. Relocating Cases for Adjustment of Status Interviews Unless USCIS determines that an interview is unnecessary, the case should be relocated to the field office with jurisdiction over the applicant’s place of residence once the case is ready for interview. The reasons for requiring an interview may include: Need to confirm the identity of the applicant; Need to validate the applicant’s immigration status; The applicant entered the United States without inspection, or there are other unresolved issues regarding the applicant’s manner of entry; There are known criminal inadmissibility or national security concerns that cannot be resolved at a service center; There are fraud concerns and the service center recommends an interview; The applicant’s fingerprints have been rejected twice; The applicant has a Class A medical condition that the service center cannot resolve through a Request for Evidence (RFE); The applicant answered “Yes” to any eligibility question on the adjustment application, and the service center cannot determine eligibility through an RFE; or The service center has not been able to obtain an applicant’s A-File, T-File, or receipt file (when the applicant has multiple files). C. Interpreters An applicant may not be fluent in English and may require use of an interpreter for the adjustment interview. In general, a disinterested party should be used as the interpreter. An officer may exercise discretion, however, to allow a friend or relative of the applicant to act as interpreter. If the officer is fluent in the applicant’s preferred language, the officer may conduct the examination in that language without use of an interpreter.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows certain aliens who are physically present in the United States to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident (LPR). Most adjustment applicants file their adjustment of status applications based on INA 245(a) B. Background The Immigration Act of 1924 required all intending immigrants to obtain an immigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad [1] (commonly known as “consular processing”). An alien physically present in the United States could not become an LPR without leaving the United States to consular process abroad. By 1935, immigration authorities had developed an administrative process of “pre-examination” that enabled an alien temporarily in the United States to obtain LPR status more quickly and easily. [2] Pre-examination consisted of an official determination in the United States of the alien’s eligibility for an immigrant visa, the immigrant’s travel to Canada or elsewhere for an arranged immigrant visa appointment at a U.S. consulate, and the immigrant’s prompt return and admission to the United States as a LPR. From 1935 to 1950, the government processed over 45,000 pre-examination cases. [3] In 1952, Congress made the pre-examination process unnecessary by creating INA 245 , which allowed eligible aliens to obtain LPR status through adjustment of status without leaving the United States. [4] Congress indicated that adjustment should be used for purposes of family unity or otherwise be in the public interest. [5] Over time, Congress revised and consolidated the eligibility requirements for adjustment of status into the current INA 245(a) . The bars, restrictions, and special considerations to adjustment are found in INA 245(c) through INA 245(k) . Applicable inadmissibility grounds, including public safety and security concerns are found in INA 212 C. Scope The guidance in this Policy Manual part only addresses adjustment of status under INA 245(a). [6] Certain aliens may be eligible to adjust under other provisions of law, as detailed in other parts of this volume. D. Legal Authorities INA 245(a) 8 CFR 245 – Adjustment of status to that of person admitted for permanent residence INA 245(c) – Bars to adjustment of status INA 245(k) – Inapplicability of certain provisions for certain employment-based immigrants Footnotes [^ 1] See Section 13 of the Immigration Act of 1924, Pub. L. 68-139 (May 26, 1924). [^ 2] See 2 C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure, Section 7.3a. See Jain v. Immigration and Naturalization Service , 612 F.2d 683 (2nd Cir. 1979). [^ 3] See Sofaer, The Change of Status Adjudication: A Case Study of the Informal Agency Process, 1 J. Legal Studies 349, 351 (1971). [^ 4] See Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Pub. L. 82-414 (PDF) (June 27, 1952). [^ 5] See H.R. Rep. 82-1365 (Feb. 14, 1952). [^ 6] There are many statutory bases for adjustment. For instance, refugees and asylees may adjust status under INA 209(c) , which outlines slightly different rules and requirements for adjustment than under INA 245(a) . The basis under which an applicant seeks adjustment of status is therefore key in determining the eligibility requirements for adjustment as well as exceptions, exemptions, waivers, and any other program-specific laws or benefits that may apply.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements An alien must meet certain eligibility requirements to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident (LPR). INA 245(a) Adjustment of Status Eligibility Requirements The alien must have been: Inspected and admitted into the United States; or Inspected and paroled into the United States. The alien must properly file an adjustment of status application. The alien must be physically present in the United States. The alien must be eligible to receive an immigrant visa. An immigrant visa must be immediately available when the alien files the adjustment of status application [1] and at the time of final adjudication. [2] The alien must be admissible to the United States for lawful permanent residence or eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief. The alien merits the favorable exercise of discretion. [3] A. “Inspected and Admitted” or “Inspected and Paroled” In 1960, Congress amended INA 245(a) and made adjustment of status available to any otherwise eligible alien who has been “inspected and admitted or paroled” into the United States. [4] Since 1960, the courts, legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service, and USCIS have read the statutory language “inspected and admitted or paroled” as: Inspected and admitted into the United States; or Inspected and paroled into the United States. This requirement must be satisfied before the alien applies for adjustment of status. [5] If an alien has not been inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled before filing an adjustment application, the officer must deny the adjustment application. [6] The inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled requirement does not apply to the following aliens seeking adjustment of status: INA 245(i) applicants; and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) applicants. [7] Special immigrant juveniles (SIJ) and other special immigrants are not exempt from this requirement. However, statutory provisions expressly state that these special immigrants are considered paroled for adjustment eligibility purposes. Accordingly, the beneficiaries of approved SIJ petitions meet the inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled requirement, regardless of their manner of arrival in the United States. [8] Certain special immigrants also meet this requirement. [9] 1. Inspection Authority Per delegation by the Secretary of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has jurisdiction over and exclusive inspection authority at ports-of-entry. [10] Definition and Scope Inspection is the formal process of determining whether an alien may lawfully enter the United States. Immigration laws as early as 1875 specified that inspection must occur prior to an alien’s landing in or entering the United States and that prohibited aliens were to be returned to the country from which they came at no cost or penalty to the conveyor or vessel. [11] Inspections for air, sea, and land arrivals are now codified in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including criminal penalties for illegal entry. [12] To lawfully enter the United States, an alien must apply and present himself or herself in person to an immigration officer at a U.S. port of entry when the port is open for inspection. [13] An alien who arrives at a port of entry and presents himself or herself for inspection is an applicant for admission. Through the inspection process, an immigration officer determines whether the alien is admissible and may enter the United States under all the applicable provisions of immigration laws. As part of the inspection, the alien must: Present any and all required documentation, including fingerprints, photographs, other biometric identifiers, documentation of status in the United States, and any other requested evidence to determine the alien’s identity and admissibility; and Establish that he or she is not subject to removal under immigration laws, Executive Orders, or Presidential Proclamations. [14] In general, if the alien presents himself or herself for questioning in person, the inspection requirement is met. [15] Nonetheless, if the alien enters the United States by falsely claiming U.S. citizenship, the alien is not considered to have been inspected by an immigration officer. In addition, the entry is not considered an admission for immigration purposes. [16] Inspection Outcomes Upon inspection, the officer at the port of entry typically decides one of the following outcomes for the alien: The officer admits them; The officer paroles them; The officer allows them to withdraw his or her application for admission and depart immediately from the United States; [17] The officer denies them admission into the United States; or The officer defers the inspection to a later time at either the same or another CBP office or a port of entry. [18] 2.

[18] 2. Admission [19] An alien is admitted if the following conditions are met: [20] The alien applied for admission as an “alien” at a port of entry; and An immigration officer inspected the applicant for admission as an “alien” and authorized him or her to enter the United States in accordance with the procedures for admission. [21] An alien who meets these two requirements is admitted, even if the alien obtained the admission by fraud. [22] Likewise, the alien is admitted, even if the CBP officer performed a cursory inspection. As long as the alien meets the procedural requirements for admission, the alien meets the inspected and admitted requirement for adjustment of status. [23] Any type of admission can meet the inspected and admitted requirement, which includes, but is not limited to, admission as a nonimmigrant, an immigrant, or a refugee. [24] Notwithstanding, if the alien makes a false claim to U.S. citizenship or to U.S. nationality at the port of entry and an immigration officer permits the alien to enter the United States, the alien has not been admitted. [25] A U.S. citizen arriving at a port of entry is not subject to inspection; therefore, an alien who makes a false claim to U.S. citizenship is considered to have entered without inspection. [26] Similarly, an alien who entered the United States after falsely claiming to be a returning LPR is not considered to have been procedurally inspected and admitted because a returning LPR generally is not an applicant for admission. [27] An LPR returning from a temporary trip abroad would only be considered to be seeking admission or readmission to the United States if any of the following factors applies: The LPR has abandoned or relinquished his or her LPR status; The LPR has been absent from the United States for a continuous period in excess of 180 days; The LPR has engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States; The LPR has departed from the United States while under legal process seeking his or her removal from the United States, including removal proceedings under the INA and extradition proceedings; The LPR has committed an offense described in the criminal-related inadmissibility grounds, unless the LPR has been granted relief for the offense; [28] The LPR is attempting to enter at a time or place other than as designated by immigration officers or has not been admitted to the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer. [29] Evidence of Admission An Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94), including a replacement [30] when appropriate, is the most common document evidencing an alien's admission. [31] The following are other types of documentation that may be accepted as proof of admission into the United States: Admission stamp in passport, which may be verified using DHS systems; Employment Authorization Card (Form I-688A), for special agricultural worker applicants, provided it was valid during the last claimed date of entry on the adjustment application; Temporary Resident Card (Form I-688), for special agricultural workers or legalization applicants granted temporary residence, provided it was valid during the last claimed date of entry on the adjustment application; and Border Crossing Card (Form I-586 or Form DSP-150 [32] ), provided it was valid on the date of last claimed entry. When inspected and admitted to the United States, the following nonimmigrants are exempt from the issuance of an Arrival/Departure Record: [33] A Canadian citizen admitted as a visitor for business, visitor for pleasure, or who was permitted to directly transit through the United States; A nonimmigrant residing in the British Virgin Islands who was admitted only to the United States Virgin Islands as a visitor for business or pleasure; [34] A Mexican national admitted with a B-1/B-2 Visa and Border Crossing Card (Form DSP-150) at a land or sea port of entry as a visitor for business or pleasure for a period of 30 days to travel within 25 miles of the border; and A Mexican national in possession of a Mexican diplomatic or official passport. [35] In these situations, an applicant should submit alternate evidence to prove his or her inspection and admission to the United States. This may include a Border Crossing Card, plane tickets evidencing travel to the United States, or other corroborating evidence. 3.

[35] In these situations, an applicant should submit alternate evidence to prove his or her inspection and admission to the United States. This may include a Border Crossing Card, plane tickets evidencing travel to the United States, or other corroborating evidence. 3. Parole Authority The Secretary of Homeland Security delegated parole authority to USCIS, CBP, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). [36] Definition and Scope An alien is paroled if the following conditions are met: They are seeking admission to the United States at a port of entry; and An immigration officer inspected them as an “alien” and permitted them to enter the United States without determining whether they may be admitted into the United States. [37] A grant of parole is a temporary and discretionary act exercised on a case-by-case basis. Parole, by definition, is not an admission. [38] Paroled for Deferred Inspection [39] On occasion, CBP grants deferred inspection to arriving aliens found inadmissible during a preliminary inspection at a port of entry. Deferred inspection is generally granted only after CBP: Verifies the alien’s identity and nationality; Determines that the alien would likely be able to overcome the identified inadmissibility by obtaining a waiver or additional evidence; and Determines that the alien does not present a national security risk to the United States. The decision to defer inspection is at the CBP officer’s discretion. If granted deferred inspection, CBP paroles the alien into the United States and defers completion of the inspection to a later time. An alien paroled for a deferred inspection typically reports for completion of inspection within 30 days of the deferral [40] to a CBP office with jurisdiction over the area where the alien will be staying or residing in the United States. [41] The grant of parole for a deferred inspection satisfies the “inspected and paroled” requirement for purposes of adjustment eligibility. [42] Urgent Humanitarian Reasons or Significant Public Benefit DHS may parole an alien based on urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit reasons. [43] DHS may grant urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit parole only on a case-by-case basis. [44] Any type of urgent humanitarian, significant public benefit, or deferred inspection-directed parole meets the “paroled into the United States” requirement. [45] Parole in Place: Parole of Certain Aliens Present Without Admission or Parole An alien who is present in the United States without inspection and admission or inspection and parole is an applicant for admission. [46] DHS can exercise its discretion to parole such an alien into the United States. [47] In general, USCIS grants parole in place only sparingly. The fact that an alien is a spouse, child, or parent of an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces, a member in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, or someone who previously served in the U.S. armed forces or the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve ordinarily weighs heavily in favor of parole in place. Absent a criminal conviction or other serious adverse factors, parole in place would generally be an appropriate exercise of discretion for such an alien. If DHS grants parole before an alien files an adjustment application, the applicant meets the “inspected and paroled” requirement for adjustment. Parole in place does not permit approval of an adjustment application that was filed before the grant of parole. [48] Parole in place does not relieve the applicant of the need to meet all other eligibility requirements for adjustment of status and the favorable exercise of discretion. [49] For example, except for immediate relatives and certain other immigrants, an applicant must have continuously maintained a lawful status since entry into the United States. [50] Conditional Parole Conditional parole is also known as release from custody. This is a separate and distinct process from parole and does not meet the “inspected and paroled” requirement for adjustment eligibility. [51] Evidence of Parole Evidence of parole includes: A parole stamp on an advance parole document; [52] A parole stamp in a passport; or An Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94) endorsed with a parole stamp. [53] 4. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands A Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) applicant who is granted parole meets the inspected and paroled requirement.

[51] Evidence of Parole Evidence of parole includes: A parole stamp on an advance parole document; [52] A parole stamp in a passport; or An Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94) endorsed with a parole stamp. [53] 4. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands A Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) applicant who is granted parole meets the inspected and paroled requirement. On May 8, 2008, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act was signed into law, which replaced the CNMI’s prior immigration laws and extended most U.S. immigration law provisions to the CNMI for the first time in history. [54] The transition period for implementation of U.S. immigration law in the CNMI began on November 28, 2009. As of that date, all aliens present in the CNMI (other than LPRs) became present in the United States by operation of law without admission or parole. In recognition of the unique situation caused by the extension of U.S. immigration laws to the CNMI, all aliens present in the CNMI on or after that date who apply for adjustment of status are considered applicants for admission [55] to the United States and are eligible for parole. Because of these unique circumstances, USCIS grants parole to applicants otherwise eligible to adjust status to serve as both an inspection and parole for purposes of meeting the requirements for adjustment. Under this policy, the USCIS Guam Field Office or the USCIS Saipan Application Support Center grants parole to an applicant otherwise eligible for parole and adjustment immediately prior to approving the adjustment of status application. 5. Temporary Protected Status A grant of temporary protected status (TPS) [56] is not, in itself, an admission for purposes of adjustment under INA 245(a) [57] Therefore, an alien who entered the United States without having been inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled, and who is subsequently granted TPS, does not meet the inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled requirement under INA 245(a) for adjustment. [58] However, a grant of TPS does not prevent an alien from demonstrating eligibility for INA 245(a) adjustment if the alien was inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled when last entering the United States. For purposes of adjustment of status under INA 245 , an alien with TPS is considered as being in and maintaining lawful status as a nonimmigrant only during the period that TPS is in effect. [59] TPS does not cure any previous failure to maintain continuously a lawful status in the United States. [60] Admission Following Travel Abroad with Prior Consent TPS beneficiaries may travel abroad temporarily with the prior consent of DHS under INA 244(f)(3) [61] When DHS provides prior consent to a TPS beneficiary to travel abroad, it documents that consent by issuing a TPS travel authorization document to the beneficiary. [62] Upon returning to the United States in accordance with the terms of DHS’s prior authorization, a TPS beneficiary must be inspected and admitted into TPS, with certain exceptions. [63] TPS beneficiaries whom DHS has inspected and admitted into TPS after such authorized travel are “inspected and admitted” for purposes of adjustment of status under INA 245(a) [64] This is true even if the TPS beneficiary was present without admission or parole when initially granted TPS. [65] However, travel with TPS authorization does not execute an outstanding removal order. [66] Past Treatment of Travel Abroad with Prior Consent Previously, USCIS issued TPS beneficiaries advance parole documents under 8 CFR 244.15 , which references the advance parole provisions as the procedure to authorize travel. Upon returning from abroad, TPS beneficiaries with advance parole documents were inspected and, if eligible, paroled into the United States. The treatment of such parole for purposes of INA 245(a) varied over the years, as summarized in the table below. Effect of Authorized Travel on TPS Beneficiaries Under Applicable Policy Date of Departure Did Parole or Admission Upon Return Satisfy INA 245(a) From December 12, 1991, until February 25, 2016 While there was no stated agency policy, aliens were generally considered paroled for the purpose of INA 245(a) (regardless of whether the beneficiary had been admitted or paroled before departing). From February 25, 2016, until August 20, 2020 Yes, regardless of whether the alien had been admitted or paroled before departing. [67] After August 20, 2020, until July 1, 2022 No, the alien’s status as admitted or paroled for INA 245(a) was unchanged by travel. [68] On or after July 1, 2022 Yes, regardless of whether the alien had been admitted or paroled before departing. [69] Retroactive Application of Current Policy In some cases, explained below, USCIS applies the current policy retroactively and considers past travel to have resulted in an inspection and admission for purposes of", "metadata": {"id": "25fc30126da68141", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "25fc30126da68141-3"}}
{"text": "aliens were generally considered paroled for the purpose of INA 245(a) (regardless of whether the beneficiary had been admitted or paroled before departing).

[67] After August 20, 2020, until July 1, 2022 No, the alien’s status as admitted or paroled for INA 245(a) was unchanged by travel. [68] On or after July 1, 2022 Yes, regardless of whether the alien had been admitted or paroled before departing. [69] Retroactive Application of Current Policy In some cases, explained below, USCIS applies the current policy retroactively and considers past travel to have resulted in an inspection and admission for purposes of INA 245(a) , even if the policy or practice in place at the time the travel occurred instructed otherwise. Past travel must meet each of the following requirements to be considered for retroactive application of current guidance: The alien obtained prior authorization to travel abroad temporarily on the basis of being a TPS beneficiary; [70] The alien’s TPS was not withdrawn, or the designation for their foreign state (or part of a foreign state) was not terminated or did not expire during their travel; [71] The alien returned to the United States in accordance with the authorization to travel; and Upon return, the alien was inspected by INS or DHS at a designated port of entry and paroled or otherwise permitted to pass into the territorial boundaries of the United States in accordance with the TPS-based travel authorization. [72] If the past travel does not meet each of these requirements, USCIS applies the policy that was in effect at the time of departure. [73] If the past travel does meet each of these requirements, USCIS will consider retroactive application of the current guidance. In cases arising in the Fifth Circuit, USCIS treats the authorized reentry after any qualifying prior travel as an inspection and admission, regardless of the procedure used when the TPS beneficiary was permitted to reenter the United States and regardless of whether the travel documentation refers to advance parole. [74] Elsewhere, USCIS determines on a case-by-case basis whether an alien who was paroled or otherwise permitted to enter after TPS-authorized travel under prior guidance should be treated as inspected and admitted for purposes of a given adjudication. USCIS makes the determination to apply this guidance retroactively based on the circumstances of the individual case, with consideration of any reliance on the prior policy, applicable law, and any other factors relevant to the individual application. In cases arising outside of the Fifth Circuit, the officer first considers whether treating qualifying prior travel as an admission, rather than parole, is necessary for the approval of the application. In most cases, whether the prior entry is treated as an admission or a parole does not affect the outcome of an application for adjustment of status under INA 245(a) [75] If the distinction between admission and parole does not affect the outcome, the officer does not make a retroactivity determination. Where the distinction between admission and parole is critical to the outcome of the adjudication, the officer assesses the individual case to determine whether to consider a prior return from TPS-authorized travel as an admission. In most instances, when the officer determines that an applicant meets all other eligibility requirements and merits adjustment of status in the exercise of discretion, it would be appropriate for the officer, on a case-by-case basis, to deem the prior parole to be an admission under the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA). [76] Five-Factor Test for Retroactivity Determination (Retail Union Test) The officer must apply the following five-factor test in any retroactivity determination for adjustment of status applications arising outside of the Fifth Circuit: [77] Factor 1: Whether the effect of TPS-authorized travel has previously been considered; Factor 2: Whether the new policy regarding the effect of TPS-authorized travel represents an abrupt departure from well-established practice or merely attempts to clarify an unsettled area of law; Factor 3: The extent to which the adjustment of status applicant to whom the new policy would apply relied on the former rule; [78] Factor 4: The burden (if any) that retroactive application of the policy would impose on the adjustment of status applicant; and Factor 5: The statutory interest in applying the new policy despite the applicant’s reliance on the old policy. [79] In the context of an adjustment of status application involving prior TPS-authorized travel, consideration of factors 1, 2, and 5 should be consistent across most cases: The effect of TPS-authorized travel under MTINA is not a question of first impression, as USCIS and INS had prior policy and practice on the question (factor 1); USCIS’ adoption of the interpretation described in", "metadata": {"id": "25fc30126da68141", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "25fc30126da68141-4"}}
{"text": "which the adjustment of status applicant to whom the new policy would apply relied on the former rule; [78] Factor 4: The burden (if any) that retroactive application of the policy would impose on the adjustment of status applicant; and Factor 5: The statutory interest in applying the new policy despite the applicant’s reliance on the old policy. [79] In the context of an adjustment of status application involving prior TPS-authorized travel, consideration of factors 1, 2, and 5 should be consistent across most cases: The effect of TPS-authorized travel under MTINA is not a question of first impression, as USCIS and INS had prior policy and practice on the question (factor 1); USCIS’ adoption of the interpretation described in this guidance is a change from USCIS’ prior practice and guidance (factor 2); and There is a strong statutory interest in applying the best interpretation of the statute (factor 5). While factors 1 and 2 may weigh against retroactive application of this policy change, factor 5 generally weighs in favor of retroactive application. The officer also considers whether a particular applicant relied on either Matter of Z-R-Z-C- or DHS’s prior use of advance parole to implement TPS travel (factor 3). [80] If the applicant did rely on past policy or practice, the officer considers whether retroactive application of the new policy would negatively affect or otherwise burden the applicant due to such reliance (factor 4). Accordingly, retroactivity determinations usually center on factors 3 and 4. In most cases the change in interpretation does not create a significant burden on the applicant but is instead favorable to the applicant, and the officer may deem a prior parole an admission for purposes of the adjustment of status application. In the rare event that a TPS beneficiary relied on being paroled into the United States, rather than being inspected and admitted, in a way that negatively impacts eligibility for adjustment of status, the officer weighs the negative impact against the other factors in the Retail Union test on a case-by-case basis. [81] In this assessment, the negative impact carries significant weight, and because factors 1 and 2 also weigh against retroactivity, officers should generally avoid retroactive application if the applicant would be harmed. [82] However, if the harm in a particular case is outweighed by the other factors, then the officer may deem a prior parole an admission in that case. USCIS expects that, under the Retail Union test, retroactive application of the current policy is appropriate in most adjustment of status applications and favorable to the applicants. 6. Asylum [83] An asylee whose adjustment application is based on his or her asylee status adjusts under INA 209(b) [84] An asylee, however, may seek to adjust under INA 245(a) if the asylee prefers to adjust on a basis other than the asylee’s status. This may arise in cases where, for example, an asylee marries a U.S. citizen and subsequently seeks to adjust status as an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen rather than under the asylee provision. In order to adjust under INA 245(a), however, the asylee must meet the eligibility requirements that apply under that provision. There may be circumstances where asylees are not able to meet certain requirements for adjustment under INA 245(a) . For instance, an alien who enters without inspection and is subsequently granted asylum does not satisfy the inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled requirement. [85] On the other hand, an asylee who departs the United States and is admitted or granted parole upon return to a port of entry meets the inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled requirement. 7. Waved Through at Port-of-Entry In some cases, an alien may claim that he or she arrived at a port of entry and presented himself or herself for inspection as an alien, but the inspector waved (allowed to pass) him or her through the port of entry without asking any questions. Where an alien physically presents himself or herself for questioning and makes no knowing false claim to U.S. citizenship, the alien is considered to have been inspected even though he or she volunteers no information and is asked no questions by the immigration authorities. Such an alien satisfies the inspected and admitted requirement of INA 245(a) as long as the alien sufficiently proves that he or she was indeed waved through by an immigration official at a port of entry. [86] An officer may find that an adjustment applicant satisfies the inspected and admitted requirement based on a claim that he or she was waved through at a port of entry if: The applicant submits evidence to support the claim, such as third-party affidavits from those with personal knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavits and corroborating documentation; and The officer determines that the claim", "metadata": {"id": "25fc30126da68141", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "25fc30126da68141-5"}}

Such an alien satisfies the inspected and admitted requirement of INA 245(a) as long as the alien sufficiently proves that he or she was indeed waved through by an immigration official at a port of entry. [86] An officer may find that an adjustment applicant satisfies the inspected and admitted requirement based on a claim that he or she was waved through at a port of entry if: The applicant submits evidence to support the claim, such as third-party affidavits from those with personal knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavits and corroborating documentation; and The officer determines that the claim is credible. [87] The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for adjustment of status. [88] Accordingly, the applicant must support and sufficiently establish the claim that he or she was admitted as an alien and not as a presumed U.S. citizen. For example, if the applicant was in a car with U.S. license plates and with U.S. citizens onboard, the applicant should submit persuasive evidence to establish he or she physically presented himself or herself to the inspector and was admitted as an alien. [89] B. Properly Filing an Adjustment Application To adjust status, an alien must file an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( Form I-485 ) in accordance with the form instructions. The adjustment application must be properly signed and accompanied by the appropriate fee. [90] The application must be filed at the correct filing location, as specified in the form instructions. USCIS rejects adjustment applications if the application is: Filed at an incorrect location; Not filed with the correct fee, unless granted a fee waiver; Not properly signed; or Filed when an immigrant visa is unavailable. [91] C. Eligible to Receive an Immigrant Visa 1. General Eligibility for an Immigrant Visa An adjustment applicant must be eligible to receive an immigrant visa. An applicant typically establishes eligibility for an immigrant visa through an immigrant petition in one of the categories listed in the table below. Eligibility to Receive an Immigrant Visa Immigrant Category Petition Who May Qualify Family-Based Petition for Alien Relative ( Form I-130 Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens [92] Unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (21 years of age and older) Spouses and unmarried children (under 21 years of age) of LPRs Unmarried sons and daughters of LPRs Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens Brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens (if the U.S. citizen is 21 years of age or older) Family-Based Petition for Alien Fiancé(e) ( Form I-129F Fiancé(e) of a U.S. citizen Family-Based Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant ( Form I-360 Widow or widower of a U.S. citizen VAWA self-petitioners Employment-Based Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker ( Form I-140 Priority workers Members of the professions holding an advanced degree or persons of exceptional ability Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers Employment-Based Immigrant Petition by Standalone Investor ( Form I-526 Standalone Investors Employment-Based Immigrant Petition by Regional Center Investor ( Form I-526E Regional Center Investors Special Immigrants Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant ( Form I-360 Religious workers Certain international employees Panama Canal Zone employees Certain physicians International organization officers and employees Special immigrant juveniles Certain U.S. armed forces members Certain broadcasters Certain Afghanistan and Iraq nationals Diversity Immigrant Visa [93] Not applicable (Diversity visas do not require a USCIS-filed petition) Diversity immigrants 2. Dependents The spouse and children of certain family-based, employment-based, and Diversity Immigrant Visa adjustment applicants may also obtain LPR status through their relationship with the principal applicant. Because the spouse and children do not have an independent basis to adjust status apart from their relationship to the principal immigrant, they are “dependents” of the principal for purpose of eligibility for adjustment of status. Dependents do not have their own underlying immigrant petition and may only adjust based on the principal’s adjustment of status. In general, dependent applicants must have the requisite relationship to the principal both at the time of filing the adjustment application and at the time of final adjudication. [94] 3. Concurrent Filing The immigrant petition establishing the underlying basis to adjust is typically filed before the alien files the adjustment application. In some instances, the applicant may file the adjustment application at the same time the immigrant petition is filed. [95] D. Immigrant Visa Immediately Available at Time of Filing and at Time of Approval In general, an immigrant visa must be available before an alien can apply for adjustment of status. [96] An immigrant visa is always available to applicants seeking adjustment as immediate relatives.

[96] An immigrant visa is always available to applicants seeking adjustment as immediate relatives. Visas are numerically limited for most other immigrant categories eligible to adjust; applicants in these numerically limited categories may need to wait until a visa is available before they can file an adjustment application. Furthermore, an immigrant visa must be available for issuance on the date USCIS approves any adjustment application. [97] E. Admissible to the United States An adjustment of status applicant must be admissible to the United States. [98] An applicant who is inadmissible may apply for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, if a waiver is available, or another form of relief. The applicable grounds of inadmissibility and any available waivers depend on the immigrant category under which the applicant is applying. [99] F. Bars to Adjustment of Status An applicant may not be eligible to apply for adjustment of status if one or more bars to adjustment applies. [100] The bars to adjustment of status may apply to applicants who either entered the United States in a particular status or manner, or committed a particular act or violation of immigration law. [101] The table below refers to aliens ineligible to apply for adjustment of status, unless otherwise exempt. [102] Aliens Barred from Adjustment of Status Alien INA Section Entries and Periods of Stay to Consider Exempt from Bar Alien Crewman [103] 245(c)(1) Only most recent permission to land, or admission prior to filing for adjustment VAWA-based applicants In Unlawful Immigration Status on the Date the Adjustment Application is Filed Who Failed to Continuously Maintain Lawful Status Since Entry into United States [104] Who Continues in, or Accepts, Unauthorized Employment Prior to Filing for Adjustment 245(c)(2) [105] All entries and time periods spent in the United States (departure and return does not remove the ineligibility) [106] VAWA-based applicants Immediate relatives [107] Certain special immigrants [108] 245(k) eligible [109] Admitted in Transit Without a Visa (TWOV) 245(c)(3) Only most recent admission prior to filing for adjustment VAWA-based applicants Admitted as a Nonimmigrant Without a Visa under a Visa Waiver Program [110] 245(c)(4) Only most recent admission prior to filing for adjustment VAWA-based applicants Immediate relatives Admitted as Witness or Informant [111] 245(c)(5) Only most recent admission prior to filing for adjustment VAWA-based applicants Who is Deportable Due to Involvement in Terrorist Activity or Group [112] 245(c)(6) All entries and time periods spent in the United States VAWA-based applicant [113] Seeking Adjustment in an Employment-based Immigrant Category and Not in a Lawful Nonimmigrant Status 245(c)(7) Only most recent admission prior to filing for adjustment VAWA-based applicants Immediate relatives and other family-based applicants Special immigrant juveniles [114] 245(k) eligible [115] Who has Otherwise Violated the Terms of a Nonimmigrant Visa [116] Who has Ever Engaged in Unauthorized Employment [117] 245(c)(8) [118] All entries and time periods spent in the United States (departure and return does not remove the ineligibility) [119] VAWA-based applicants Immediate relatives [120] Certain special immigrants 245(k) eligible [121] In all cases, the applicant is subject to any and all applicable grounds of inadmissibility even if the applicant is not subject to any bar to adjustment, or is exempt from any or all the bars to adjustment. 1. Overlapping Bars Some bars to adjustment may overlap in their application, despite their basis in separate sections of the law. [122] For example, an applicant admitted under the Visa Waiver Program who overstays the admission is barred by both INA 245(c)(2) and INA 245(c)(4) . Because some bars overlap, more than one bar can apply to an applicant for the same act or violation. In such cases, the officer should address each applicable adjustment bar in the denial notice. 2. Exemptions from the Bars [123] Congress has provided relief from particular adjustment bars to certain categories of immigrants such as VAWA-based adjustment applicants, immediate relatives, and designated special immigrants. Furthermore, INA 245(k) exempts eligible applicants under the employment-based 1st, 2nd, 3rd and certain 4th preference [124] categories from the INA 245(c)(2) INA 245(c)(7) , and INA 245(c)(8) bars.

L. 104-208 (PDF) , 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-575 (September 30, 1996). INA 101(a)(13)(B) clarifies that parole is not admission. [^ 20] See INA 101(a)(13)(A) (“The terms ‘admission’ and ‘admitted’ mean, with respect to an alien, the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.”).

For more information on admissibility, see Volume 8, Admissibility [ 8 USCIS-PM [^ 24] A grant of nonimmigrant status to an alien in the United States does not automatically constitute an “admission.” For example, an alien who is present in the United States without being inspected and admitted or paroled and who is subsequently granted U nonimmigrant status while in the United States is not “admitted” for purposes of INA 245(a).

USCIS applied these rulings only to applications for adjustment of status filed by applicants residing within these respective jurisdictions. The Supreme Court decision in Sanchez overrules the rulings of the Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits; therefore, on or after June 7, 2021, a grant of TPS is no longer an admission for adjustment of status purposes in any circuit.

Although 8 CFR 244.15 provides that permission to travel abroad is sought and provided “pursuant to the Service’s advance parole provisions,” the regulation was issued in 1991 before enactment of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), Pub. L. 102-232 (PDF) (December 12, 1991), as amended, and, consequently, the reference in 8 CFR 244.15 to advance parole was overruled by Section 304(c) of that statute, which required that eligible TPS beneficiaries “shall be inspected and admitted” upon return from qualifying authorized travel. See DHS Office of General Counsel, Immigration Consequences of Authorized Travel and Return to the United States by Individuals Holding Temporary Protected Status , Attachment p. 28, issued April 6, 2022. Until 8 CFR 244.15 is amended in accordance with MTINA, and corresponding changes are made to related forms and other documentation, USCIS considers the reference to advance parole in 8 CFR 244.15 to encompass any advance discretionary authorization to travel under INA 244(f)(3) .

L. 102-232 (PDF) , 105 Stat. 1733, 1749 (December 12, 1991), as amended. [^ 74] See Duarte v. Mayorkas , 27 F.4th 1044, 1061 (5th Cir. 2022) (concluding that “USCIS was … not authorized to grant the Appellants the advance parole that the 512L form it issued them purported to allow” and that as a result they “were admitted and not paroled into the country”). [^ 75] Determining whether a prior entry was an admission or parole may be necessary, for example, in employment-based adjustment of status applications by aliens seeking an exception to the bars to adjustment in INA 245(c)(2) (7) , and (8) . The exception at INA 245(k) requires, in part, that the applicant be present in the United States “pursuant to a lawful admission.” In such cases, USCIS conducts the individualized assessment described above. [^ 76] See Pub. L. 102-232 (PDF) (December 12, 1991), as amended. [^ 77] The five-factor test formulated by the D.C. Circuit entails consideration of whether the particular case is one of first impression, whether the new rule represents an abrupt departure from well-established practice or merely attempts to fill a void in an unsettled area of law, the extent to which the party against whom the new rule is applied relied on the former rule, the degree of the burden which a retroactive order imposes on a party, and the statutory interest in applying a new rule despite the reliance of a party on the old standard. See Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union AFL-CIO v. NLRB , 466 F.2d 380, 390 (D.C. Cir. 1972). See Montgomery Ward & Co. v. FTC , 691 F.2d 1322 (9th Cir. 1982). See Matter of Cordero-Garcia , 27 I&N Dec. 652, 657 (BIA 2019) (adopting the test in the immigration context). [^ 78] “The former rule” meaning prior USCIS or INS legal interpretation, policy, or practice regarding the effect of TPS-authorized travel. [^ 79] See Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union AFL-CIO v. NLRB , 466 F.2d 380, 390 (D.C. Cir. 1972). [^ 80] See the table, Effect of Authorized Travel on TPS Beneficiaries Under Applicable Policy, above. [^ 81] See Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union AFL-CIO v. NLRB , 466 F.2d 380, 390 (D.C. Cir. 1972). Because USCIS applies the holding of Matter of Arrabally and Yerrabelly (PDF) , 25 I&N Dec. 771 (BIA 2012) to travel authorized under INA 244(f)(3) followed by admission to the United States into TPS, an alien who leaves the United States temporarily on TPS-authorized travel does not make a departure from the United States within the meaning of INA 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) . Therefore, whether or not USCIS considers travel under MTINA as an admission after authorized travel or a parole after advance parole will not adversely affect aliens with respect to reliance upon Matter of Arrabally [^ 82] See Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union AFL-CIO v. NLRB , 466 F.2d 380, 390 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (citing SEC v.

{"text": "Chapter 3 - Unlawful Immigration Status at Time of Filing (INA 245(c)(2)) An applicant is barred from adjustment of status if the applicant is in an unlawful immigration status on the date of filing the adjustment application. [1] This bar to adjustment does not apply to: Immediate relatives; [2] Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)-based applicants; Certain alien doctors and their accompanying spouse and children; [3] Certain G-4 international organization employees, NATO-6 employees, and their family members; [4] Special immigrant juveniles; [5] Certain members of the U.S. armed forces and their spouses and children; [6] Employment-based applicants who meet the INA 245(k) exemption. A. Lawful Immigration Status [7] Aliens in the United States who are considered to be in lawful immigration status generally include: Lawful permanent residents (LPR), including lawful temporary residents and conditional permanent residents; Nonimmigrants; [8] Refugees; [9] ​Asylees; [10] Parolees; [11] Aliens in temporary protected status (TPS); and Aliens lawfully present in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) between November 28, 2009 and November 27, 2011 based on a valid, unexpired, and lawfully obtained period of stay that was CNMI-authorized prior to November 28, 2009 that remains valid on the date of adjustment application. Simply filing an application for an immigration benefit or having a pending benefit application generally does not put an applicant in a lawful immigration status. [12] In general, once an immigrant benefit application is approved, an applicant is in lawful immigration status as of the date of the filing of the application. B. Unlawful Immigration Status An alien is in unlawful immigration status if he or she is in the United States without lawful immigration status either because the alien never had lawful status or because the alien’s lawful status has ended. Aliens in unlawful immigration status generally include those: Who entered the United States without inspection and admission or parole; [13] and Whose lawful immigration status expired or was rescinded, revoked, or otherwise terminated. [14] C. Time in Unlawful Immigration Status If in unlawful immigration status, the alien’s unlawful status generally begins: On the day the alien enters the United States without inspection; ​On the day the alien violates the terms or conditions of his or her nonimmigrant status; [15] ​On the day after the alien’s authorized status has been violated, has expired, been rescinded, revoked, or otherwise terminated while he or she is physically present in the United States. [16] Unlawful immigration status generally ends when either of the following events occur, whichever is earlier: The alien obtains lawful immigration status, or ​The alien departs the United States. D. Difference between Lawful Immigration Status and Period of Authorized Stay Lawful immigration status is distinct from being in a period of authorized stay. Periods of authorized stay are only relevant when determining an alien’s accrual of unlawful presence for inadmissibility purposes. [17] Although an alien in a lawful immigration status is also in a period of authorized stay, the opposite is not necessarily true. Those in a period of authorized stay may or may not be in a lawful immigration status. Officers consider the difference between lawful immigration status and a period of authorized stay when determining whether an applicant is in lawful immigration status for purposes of the INA 245(c)(2) adjustment bar. E. Effect of Pending Application or Petition A pending application to extend or change status ( Form I-129 Form I-539 ), a pending adjustment application, or a pending petition does not confer lawful immigration status on an applicant. In addition, a pending application or petition does not automatically afford protection against removal if the alien’s status expires after submission of the application. The alien may have no actual lawful status in the United States and may be subject to removal proceedings unless and until the extension of stay (EOS) application, change of status (COS) application, adjustment application, or petition is approved. 1. Extension of Stay or Change of Status An alien may file an adjustment application after expiration of his or her nonimmigrant status while the alien's timely-filed EOS or COS application is pending. [18] In such cases, the officer should defer adjudication of the adjustment application until USCIS adjudicates the EOS or COS application so long as there are no other grounds for denial. If USCIS ultimately approves the EOS or COS application, then the alien is considered to be in lawful immigration status on the date the adjustment application is filed. If USCIS denies the EOS or COS application, then the alien is generally considered to be in unlawful immigration status as of the expiration of the alien's current nonimmigrant status and likewise on the date the adjustment application is filed. In this instance, the INA 245(c)(2) bar would apply, unless an exemption is available. The following scenario illustrates the distinction between lawful immigration status and", "metadata": {"id": "7f9eea46905580b7", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-b-chapter-3", "title": "Chapter 3 - Unlawful Immigration Status at Time of Filing (INA 245(c)(2)) | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "7f9eea46905580b7-0"}}

If USCIS denies the EOS or COS application, then the alien is generally considered to be in unlawful immigration status as of the expiration of the alien's current nonimmigrant status and likewise on the date the adjustment application is filed. In this instance, the INA 245(c)(2) bar would apply, unless an exemption is available. The following scenario illustrates the distinction between lawful immigration status and a period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The scenario provides an example of when an applicant may be considered to be in unlawful immigration status after filing multiple applications to extend and change status. Example: Effect of Multiple Applications to Extend or Change Status Date Event September 28, 2007 An alien is admitted to the United States as a B-2 nonimmigrant visitor. March 16, 2008 An employer timely filed an L-1 petition (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker ( Form I-129 ) for the B-2 nonimmigrant visitor, including a request on behalf of the nonimmigrant to change status to an L-1 nonimmigrant intracompany transferee nonimmigrant classification. March 28, 2008 The B-2 nonimmigrant visitor’s authorized stay expires, as indicated on the Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94). September 10, 2008 The alien untimely filed an application to extend B-2 nonimmigrant visitor status after the employer receives a Request for Evidence (RFE) on the L-1 petition. December 7, 2008 The RFE goes unanswered and USCIS denies the L-1 petition and the accompanying COS application. January 11, 2009 The employer untimely files a second L-1 petition (Form I-129) for the alien. February 8, 2009 USCIS denies the alien's application to extend B-2 nonimmigrant visitor status because it was filed after the expiration of his authorized stay. February 11, 2009 USCIS approves the second L-1 petition (Form I-129) for the alien but denies the accompanying application to change status from B-2 nonimmigrant visitor to L-1 because the alien was out of status at the time the petition was filed. This example highlights that an alien seeking an EOS or COS cannot indefinitely avoid any time out of or in violation of lawful status just because of a pending application to extend or change status. When USCIS denied the first L-1 petition and COS application on December 7, 2008, the applicant was out of B-2 status as of March 29, 2008. Even though USCIS ultimately denied the first L-1 petition and COS request, the petition was timely filed. Accordingly, the petition provided the alien a period of authorized stay while the petition was pending from March 16, 2008 through final adjudication on December 7, 2008. Notwithstanding, the untimely filed application for extension of B-2 status did not provide the alien any period of authorized stay. In addition, the applications and petitions filed did not grant any lawful status to the alien or create a “bridge” of continuing lawful status stemming from the first timely filed petition. 2. Adjustment A pending adjustment application does not put an applicant in a lawful immigration status. For example, if USCIS previously denied adjustment of status to an applicant and the applicant reapplies for adjustment, the period the first application was pending does not count as time spent in lawful immigration status. 3. Petition A pending or approved petition does not confer lawful immigration status on the beneficiary. An immigrant petition merely classifies the beneficiary in a particular immigrant visa category, which forms the basis for the beneficiary’s adjustment application.

The alien’s status also becomes unlawful if the alien remains in the United States after DHS terminates the alien’s nonimmigrant status under 8 CFR 214.1(d) [^ 15] The relevant terms or conditions include those that apply to all nonimmigrants, such as 8 CFR 214.1(e)-(g) , as well as those that apply to the specific nonimmigrant classification. For example, a B-2 visitor who worked without authorization and an F-1 student who failed to maintain a full course of study would both be out of status.

Those in a period of stay authorized are protected from accruing unlawful presence. For example, an alien whose adjustment of status application is pending is in a period of stay authorized and does not accrue unlawful presence. However, although an alien is in a period of stay authorized, it may be that the alien is in unlawful status. See Section E, Effect of a Pending Application or Petition [ 7 USCIS-PM B.3(E) [^ 18] In some cases, USCIS may excuse untimely filing and approve an extension of stay or change of status request.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose Certain aliens physically present in the United States may be ineligible to adjust status under INA 245(a) because they entered the United States without inspection, violated their nonimmigrant status, were employed in the United States without authorization, or are otherwise barred from adjustment by INA 245(c). [1] Congress enacted INA 245(i) to allow certain otherwise ineligible aliens a pathway to become lawful permanent residents provided they meet specific requirements. [2] B. Background Congress initially enacted INA 245(i) in 1994 as a temporary measure providing certain aliens who were otherwise ineligible for adjustment with a pathway to adjust to permanent resident status. [3] The law required that 245(i) applicants file an application and pay an additional statutory sum (sometimes also referred to as a “fee”) by the sunset date. The law originally was scheduled to expire on October 1, 1997. After several short term extensions, Congress made INA 245(i) permanent by repealing the sunset date and replacing it with a requirement that an applicant be the beneficiary (including a spouse or child of the principal beneficiary, if otherwise eligible under INA 203(d)) of an immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application filed on or before January 14, 1998. [4] In 2000, Congress extended the deadline for filing the qualifying petition or application until April 30, 2001 and added a new requirement that an applicant basing his or her eligibility on being a beneficiary of a qualifying petition or application filed after January 14, 1998, establish that the principal beneficiary of the qualifying petition or application was physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000 in order to adjust status under INA 245(i). [5] C. Overcoming INA 245(a) Adjustment Ineligibility Aliens may seek to adjust status under INA 245(i) if they are disqualified from adjusting status under INA 245(a) [6] INA 245(i) may overcome any or all of the following reasons for 245(a) adjustment ineligibility, to include circumstances where the alien: [7] Last entered the United States without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer; [8] Last entered the United States as an alien crewman; [9] Is now employed or has ever been employed in the United States without authorization; [10] Is not in lawful immigration status on the date of filing the application for adjustment of status; [11] Has ever failed to continuously maintain a lawful status since entry into the United States; [12] Was last admitted to the United States in transit without a visa; [13] Was last admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor without a visa under the Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Visa Waiver Program; [14] Was last admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor without a visa under the Visa Waiver Program; [15] Is seeking employment-based adjustment of status, and is not in a lawful nonimmigrant status on the date of filing the application for adjustment of status; [16] and Has ever violated the terms of his or her nonimmigrant status. [17] D. Two-Step Adjudication INA 245(i) adjustment application differs from all other adjustment applications because it involves a two-step adjudication process. Overview of Adjudication of 245(i) Adjustment Applications Step 1 Determine whether the 245(i) applicant qualifies as: A grandfathered alien, or A grandfathered alien’s current spouse or child. Step 2 Determine whether the applicant is otherwise eligible to adjust under 245(i). In processing 245(i) adjustment of status applications, officers should follow the general adjustment guidelines for adjudication and final decision procedures. [18] E.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Grandfathering Requirements An officer must first determine whether an INA 245(i) applicant qualifies as a grandfathered alien or as the current spouse or child of a grandfathered alien at the time of adjustment. A. Definition of Grandfathered Alien A grandfathered alien is or was the principal or derivative beneficiary [1] of: A qualifying immigrant visa petition; or A qualifying labor certification application. [2] If the qualifying immigrant visa petition or labor certification application was filed after January 14, 1998, the principal beneficiary must also have been physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000. B. Qualifying Immigrant Visa Petition or Labor Certification Application A qualifying immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application is defined as a petition or application that was both “properly filed” on or before April 30, 2001 and “approvable when filed.” [3] A qualifying immigrant visa petition [4] may include any of the following forms: Petition for Alien Relative ( Form I-130 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker ( Form I-140 Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant ( Form I-360 Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur ( Form I-526 A qualifying permanent labor certification application [5] refers to an Application for Alien Labor Certification (ETA Form 750). [6] 1. Properly Filed [7] Qualifying Immigrant Visa Petition For purposes of INA 245(i), an immigrant visa petition is considered properly filed if: The petition was physically received by legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) [8] on or before April 30, 2001, or, if mailed, postmarked on or before April 30, 2001, regardless of when INS received it; and The petition was submitted with the correct fees and proper signature. [9] A petition received with either an illegible or missing postmark is timely filed if INS physically received the petition by May 3, 2001, and stamped it with a “Filed Prior to 245(i) Sunset” stamp. [10] Qualifying Permanent Labor Certification Application A permanent labor certification application is properly filed if it was filed on or before April 30, 2001 and accepted for processing according to the regulations of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) that existed at the time of filing. During the INA 245(i) qualifying time period and under authority delegated by DOL, permanent labor certification applications were generally filed directly with the state workforce agency (SWA) (such as a State Employment Service Agency) in the state where the offered job was located. The SWA indicated the filing date or receipt date on the first page of the ETA Form 750, Part A in the “Endorsements” block located in the lower right corner, specifically in the area indicated as “L.O.” (which indicates “local office”). Therefore, a permanent labor certification application is considered properly filed where the SWA date-stamped the application, thereby indicating the application was complete and accepted for processing. Such a complete application remains properly filed, notwithstanding any need for the employer to amend the application or provide additional documents and information as required by DOL to ultimately obtain a favorable adjudication of the application. [11] Permanent labor certification applications received by a SWA that do not bear a “Filed Prior to 245(i) Sunset” stamp may meet INA 245(i) filing requirements if they were given a receipt date of no later than April 30, 2001. USCIS accepts the receipt date that the DOL or SWA ultimately assigned to the permanent labor certification application. 2. Approvable When Filed [12] An immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application is considered “approvable when filed” if the petition or application was: Properly filed; Meritorious in fact; and Non-frivolous. Therefore, once the petition or application is determined to have been properly filed, [13] the petition or application is considered approvable when filed if it is both meritorious in fact and non-frivolous. Meritorious in Fact: Immigrant Visa Petition To be considered “meritorious in fact,” the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition must have met all the substantive eligibility requirements at the time of filing for the specified immigrant category. Stated another way, the immigrant visa petition is meritorious in fact if the petition merited a legal victory upon filing had it been fully adjudicated, even if the petition was not fully processed or actually approved. [14] For example, a beneficiary claiming to be the child of a U.S. citizen must have met the definition of a child [15] at the time the immigrant petition was filed. In the case of a marriage-based immigrant visa petition, the marriage must have been bona fide at its inception. [16] USCIS will consider all available evidence to determine if the beneficiary met all the eligibility requirements at the time of filing, including evidence of fraud. Meritorious in Fact: Permanent Labor Certification Application The standard for determining whether a permanent labor certification application is meritorious in fact is different than", "metadata": {"id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-c-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Grandfathering Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151-0"}}
{"text": "legal victory upon filing had it been fully adjudicated, even if the petition was not fully processed or actually approved. [14] For example, a beneficiary claiming to be the child of a U.S. citizen must have met the definition of a child [15] at the time the immigrant petition was filed. In the case of a marriage-based immigrant visa petition, the marriage must have been bona fide at its inception. [16] USCIS will consider all available evidence to determine if the beneficiary met all the eligibility requirements at the time of filing, including evidence of fraud. Meritorious in Fact: Permanent Labor Certification Application The standard for determining whether a permanent labor certification application is meritorious in fact is different than for immigrant petitions: whereas the substantive eligibility requirements for immigrant petitions are fixed at the time of filing, that is not the case for permanent labor certification applications. Specifically, the terms and conditions of employment stated in the original application (such as job qualifications and rate of pay) are subject to the requirements as stated on the application for permanent labor certification. A permanent labor certification application is considered meritorious in fact if: The employer filing the application was extending a bona fide offer of employment; The employer had the apparent ability to hire the beneficiary; and There is no evidence of fraud. Accordingly, a properly filed labor certification application is presumed to be meritorious in fact if the application is non-frivolous and if no apparent bars to approval existed at the time it was filed. [17] Factors for Determining Approvable When Filed Approval or denial of a qualifying immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application is not determinative. However, if an immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application was ultimately approved, the petition or application was generally approvable when filed. [18] Likewise, if the qualifying immigrant visa petition or labor certification application was ultimately denied or revoked, the petition or application is generally not considered “approvable when filed” unless it was denied due to circumstances that arose after the time of filing. [19] In all cases, USCIS bases the determination of approvable when filed on the circumstances that existed at the time the immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application was filed. For example, a petition or application may still be considered “approvable when filed” even if the employer filing the petition or application later went out of business. [20] A petition or application that was properly filed on or before April 30, 2001, and was approvable when filed may grandfather the beneficiary even if the petition was later withdrawn, denied, or revoked due to circumstances that arose after the time of filing. [21] This same principle applies if the U.S. Department of State later terminates the beneficiary’s immigrant visa registration. [22] Non-Frivolous An immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application is “frivolous” if the petition or application is deemed to be “patently without substance.” [23] Therefore, a non-frivolous petition or application is one filed in good faith and is based on a reasonable belief that there is some basis in law or fact for approval; a frivolous filing is one completely lacking in legal merit and is expected to be denied. [24] 3. Used Petitions and Applications Once a qualifying immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application has been used by an alien as the basis for obtaining lawful permanent resident (LPR) status, [25] the petition or application cannot be used again. [26] A qualifying petition or application does not grandfather a beneficiary if that beneficiary has previously obtained LPR status on the basis of that petition or application. [27] To determine whether a petition or application has been used previously, an officer should check available USCIS and DOL systems as needed. C. Beneficiary of Qualifying Immigrant Visa Petition or Permanent Labor Certification Application 1. Special Considerations for Principal Beneficiaries A principal beneficiary for purposes of INA 245(i) grandfathering is either: The alien named as the direct beneficiary on the qualifying immigrant visa petition; or The alien named on the qualifying permanent labor certification application as the person to whom the U.S. employer is extending an offer of employment. Substituted Principal Beneficiary of a Permanent Labor Certification Application An alien may be eligible to adjust under INA 245(i) if the employer who filed a qualifying permanent labor certification application properly substituted the alien as the beneficiary of the application effective on or before April 30, 2001. The substitution makes the original beneficiary ineligible for 245(i) adjustment based on that application. [28] Example: Timely Substituted Principal Beneficiary of Qualifying Application Date Event March 1, 1998 An employer properly files a permanent labor certification application for an employee that was approvable when filed and which DOL ultimately approved. April 1, 2001 The employer substituted a", "metadata": {"id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-c-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Grandfathering Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151-1"}}
{"text": "certification application as the person to whom the U.S. employer is extending an offer of employment. Substituted Principal Beneficiary of a Permanent Labor Certification Application An alien may be eligible to adjust under INA 245(i) if the employer who filed a qualifying permanent labor certification application properly substituted the alien as the beneficiary of the application effective on or before April 30, 2001. The substitution makes the original beneficiary ineligible for 245(i) adjustment based on that application. [28] Example: Timely Substituted Principal Beneficiary of Qualifying Application Date Event March 1, 1998 An employer properly files a permanent labor certification application for an employee that was approvable when filed and which DOL ultimately approved. April 1, 2001 The employer substituted a new employee for the original employee because the employer no longer intended to use the approved labor certification application for the original employee. The employer files an employment-based immigrant visa petition for the new employee, requesting substitution and using the labor certification application initially approved for the original employee. June 1, 2003 The new employee files an adjustment of status application based on the petition filed by the employer. In this example, the new employee may seek to adjust as a principal beneficiary under INA 245(i) because the person was the properly substituted beneficiary of the approved labor certification application at the time the 245(i) filing period ended on April 30, 2001. The original employee may not seek 245(i) adjustment on the basis of this permanent labor certification application because the person was replaced as the beneficiary prior to April 30, 2001. However, an untimely substitution (that is, one occurring after April, 30, 2001) would not affect the original principal beneficiary’s eligibility to seek 245(i) adjustment. 2. Special Considerations for Derivative Beneficiaries Grandfathering Eligibility A qualifying immigrant visa petition or labor certification application may serve to grandfather the principal beneficiary’s immediate family members at the time the visa petition or labor certification application was filed (his or her spouse and child(ren)) as grandfathered derivative beneficiaries. [29] The spouse or child does not have to be named in the qualifying petition or application and does not have to continue to be the principal beneficiary’s spouse or child. As long as an applicant can demonstrate that he or she was the spouse or child (unmarried and under 21 years of age) of a grandfathered principal beneficiary on the date the qualifying petition or application was properly filed, the applicant is grandfathered and eligible to seek INA 245(i) adjustment in his or her own right. [30] A derivative beneficiary who qualifies as a grandfathered alien may benefit from INA 245(i) in the same way as a principal beneficiary. If the derivative beneficiary meets all eligibility requirements, the beneficiary may adjust despite an entry without inspection or being subject to the specified adjustment bars. [31] Underlying Basis for Adjustment If a grandfathered derivative beneficiary [32] remains the spouse or child of the grandfathered principal beneficiary, the derivative beneficiary may accompany or follow to join the principal beneficiary, provided the principal beneficiary is adjusting status under INA 245(i). In this case, the grandfathered principal beneficiary is the principal adjustment applicant and the grandfathered derivative beneficiary is the derivative applicant. [33] A grandfathered derivative beneficiary may also adjust under INA 245(i) in his or her own right, on some basis completely independent of the grandfathered principal beneficiary. [34] This is true whether or not the grandfathered derivative beneficiary remains the grandfathered principal beneficiary’s spouse or child. For instance, a grandfathered derivative beneficiary spouse who becomes divorced from the grandfathered principal beneficiary after the qualifying petition or application is filed is still a grandfathered alien eligible to seek adjustment independently under 245(i). Similarly, a grandfathered derivative beneficiary child who marries or reaches 21 years of age after the qualifying petition or application is filed is still grandfathered and eligible to seek INA 245(i) adjustment on his or her own basis through a different petition. Example: Derivative Beneficiary Eligible After Divorce from Principal Beneficiary Date Event January 1, 2000 An employer files a permanent labor certification application on behalf of a married employee.

The application is determined to be approvable when filed and the married employee alien is a grandfathered alien. As the employee was married at the time the labor certification application was filed, the employee’s spouse is the derivative beneficiary and is also a grandfathered alien. January 1, 2003 The employee and spouse divorce. Today The employee’s former spouse is selected in the diversity visa program. In this example, the employee is the grandfathered principal beneficiary for INA 245(i) adjustment because the qualifying permanent labor certification application was filed directly on the employee’s behalf before April 30, 2001. The employee’s former spouse is a grandfathered derivative beneficiary because they were married at the time the qualifying permanent labor certification application was filed. The qualifying application serves to grandfather both the principal and derivative beneficiaries. Therefore, as a grandfathered derivative beneficiary, the former spouse may apply for adjustment under 245(i) based on being selected in the diversity visa program, regardless of the grandfathered principal beneficiary’s basis for adjustment and regardless of the fact that their marital relationship no longer exists. If a grandfathered derivative beneficiary is adjusting on a separate basis from the grandfathered principal beneficiary, the grandfathered derivative beneficiary becomes the principal adjustment applicant. As the principal applicant, the grandfathered derivative beneficiary’s current spouse and child(ren) may accompany (or follow-to-join) the applicant. [35] 3. Determining Whether An Adjustment Applicant Qualifies as Grandfathered Alien for 245(i) The following flowchart provides a step-by-step process for determining whether an adjustment applicant meets the definition of a grandfathered alien. In addition to being a grandfathered alien, INA 245(i) applicants must also meet all other eligibility requirements to adjust under 245(i). [36] Step-by-Step Determination: Grandfathered Alien Step If yes, then… If no, then… Step 1: Is the applicant a principal or derivative beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition? Go to Step 3. Go to Step 2. Step 2: Is the applicant a principal or derivative beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application? Go to Step 3. The applicant is not eligible for 245(i) adjustment. Step 3: Was the petition or application filed on or before April 30, 2001? [37] Go to Step 4. The applicant is not eligible for 245(i) adjustment. Step 4: Has the applicant previously obtained LPR status on the basis of the petition or application? The applicant is not eligible for 245(i) adjustment. [38] Go to Step 5. Step 5: Was the petition or application properly filed? Go to Step 6. The applicant is not eligible for 245(i) adjustment. Step 6: Was the petition or application approvable when filed? The applicant is a grandfathered alien. The applicant is not eligible for 245(i) adjustment. 4. Effect of Grandfathering Once a 245(i) adjustment applicant establishes that he or she is a grandfathered alien, the applicant remains grandfathered and future eligibility for adjustment under INA 245(i) is preserved until the applicant adjusts to LPR status. [39] The applicant may use the qualifying petition or application as the basis for adjustment of status if the petition or application is still valid. In addition, the applicant may seek to adjust under another family-based, employment-based, special immigrant, or diversity visa immigrant category for which the applicant is eligible. [40] Effect on Lawful Status and Unlawful Presence The fact that an alien is determined to be a grandfathered alien for INA 245(i) purposes does not confer any immigration status on the alien nor does it place the alien in a period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security for purposes of stopping the accrual of any unlawful presence pursuant to INA 212(a)(9). [41] An alien’s nonimmigrant status is not affected by the fact that he or she is eligible to seek 245(i) benefits. [42] D. Current Family Members of Grandfathered Aliens In general, today’s principal adjustment applicant’s spouse or child(ren) [43] may also adjust status if “accompanying” or “following-to-join” the principal. [44] A spouse or child is “accompanying” the principal when seeking to adjust status together with the principal or within 6 months of when the principal became a permanent resident; the spouse or child is considered to be following-to-join if seeking to adjust more than 6 months after the principal became a permanent resident. [45] The spouse and child(ren) as of the date of adjustment accompanying (or following-to-join) a principal INA 245(i) applicant (who is a grandfathered alien) are eligible to seek adjustment under 245(i) even though they are not grandfathered aliens in their own right. The spouse and child(ren) may also benefit from INA 245(i) provisions allowing applicants to adjust despite an entry without inspection or being subject to the specified adjustment bars. [46] If the spouse and child(ren) were properly inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled", "metadata": {"id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-c-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Grandfathering Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151-3"}}

The spouse and child(ren) may also benefit from INA 245(i) provisions allowing applicants to adjust despite an entry without inspection or being subject to the specified adjustment bars. [46] If the spouse and child(ren) were properly inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled (and are not subject to the INA 245(c) bars) they do not need to file a Supplement A . The spouse and child(ren) may simply seek adjustment under INA 245(a) by filing only the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( Form I-485 1. Grandfathered Principal Beneficiary’s Spouse and Children An alien may be eligible to adjust as a grandfathered derivative beneficiary under INA 245(i) in his or her own right or as an accompanying (or following-to-join) spouse or child if: The alien demonstrates that he or she was the spouse or child (unmarried and under 21 years of age) of a grandfathered principal beneficiary at the time a qualifying petition or application was properly filed; and The alien is still the spouse or child of the principal beneficiary. [47] An alien who became the spouse or child of a grandfathered principal beneficiary after the qualifying petition or application was filed may only seek INA 245(i) adjustment through the principal beneficiary as an accompanying (or following-to-join) immigrant. [48] These applicants do not qualify as grandfathered derivative beneficiaries who may adjust in their own right under INA 245(i). [49] Example: Spouse and Child Acquired After Filing of Principal Beneficiary’s Qualifying Application Date Event January 1, 1998 An alien enters the United States without inspection. January 1, 2000 An employer files a permanent labor certification application on behalf of the alien. The alien is unmarried at time of filing. January 1, 2002 The alien marries an alien and has a child. January 1, 2004 The employment-based immigrant visa petition filed on the alien’s behalf is approved. The alien applies for adjustment of status, as do the spouse and child. As a principal beneficiary of the qualifying permanent labor certification application, the alien is grandfathered and eligible to file for adjustment under INA 245(i) . Because the alien married and had the child after the qualifying application was filed, the spouse and child are not grandfathered derivative beneficiaries and may not adjust in their own right under 245(i). The spouse and child, however, may still seek INA 245(i) adjustment (or INA 245(a) adjustment, if eligible) as the principal beneficiary’s accompanying (or following-to-join) spouse and child under INA 203(d). Eligibility of Grandfathered Principal Beneficiary’s Spouse or Child The following chart provides a summary of whether the spouse or child of a grandfathered principal beneficiary may be grandfathered in his or her own right or eligible to accompany or follow to join the grandfathered principal beneficiary. 245(i) Adjustment Eligibility of Grandfathered Principal Beneficiary’s Spouse or Child When Was Relationship Established? Eligible as an Accompanying or Following-to-Join Applicant? Eligible as a Grandfathered Derivative Beneficiary Who May Apply to Adjust Under INA 245(i) Independently from Principal? Before the qualifying petition or application was filed (on or before April 30, 2001) Yes, if relationship continues to exist and principal beneficiary is granted LPR status (and remains an LPR) Yes, on a different basis, whether or not relationship to principal beneficiary continues to exist [50] After April 30, 2001 but before principal beneficiary adjusts status Yes, if relationship continues to exist and principal beneficiary is granted LPR status (and remains an LPR) After principal beneficiary adjusts status 2. Grandfathered Derivative Beneficiary’s Spouse and Children Derivative beneficiaries of a qualifying immigrant visa petition or labor certification application are grandfathered in their own right. These grandfathered derivative beneficiaries may adjust independently from the principal beneficiary of the grandfathering petition or application. Accordingly, their current spouse and children may be eligible to adjust under the usual accompanying or following-to-join rules. Continuing Spouse or Child Relationship Required The accompanying (or following-to-join) spouse or child must continue to have the qualifying relationship with the principal adjustment applicant (grandfathered derivative beneficiary) both at the time of filing and approval of their individual adjustment applications. [51] Example: Child Derivative Beneficiary Now a Married Adult Date Event July 1, 1999 An alien enters the United States without inspection with his or her child. April 30, 2001 A family-based 4th preference immigrant visa petition is properly filed on the alien’s behalf and was approvable when filed.", "metadata": {"id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-c-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Grandfathering Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151-4"}}

[51] Example: Child Derivative Beneficiary Now a Married Adult Date Event July 1, 1999 An alien enters the United States without inspection with his or her child. April 30, 2001 A family-based 4th preference immigrant visa petition is properly filed on the alien’s behalf and was approvable when filed. The alien is the principal beneficiary of the immigrant petition. The alien’s child is a derivative beneficiary. For the purposes of adjustment of status under INA 245(i), both the alien and the alien’s child are grandfathered. June 1, 2008 The child is now an adult and marries another alien. March 1, 2010 USCIS approves an employment-based petition filed on behalf of the former child and the former child files an application for adjustment of status seeking to utilize INA 245(i) In this example, the alien’s qualifying petition serves to grandfather both the alien and the alien’s child. After marrying, the child is no longer considered a child for classification purposes and therefore can no longer adjust with the grandfathered principal beneficiary as an accompanying (or following-to-join) child. However, as a grandfathered derivative beneficiary, the former child may independently adjust under a new basis. The former child’s spouse may seek to adjust as an accompanying (or following-to-join) spouse. The spouse, while not a grandfathered alien based on the 1999 petition in this example, may adjust under INA 245(i) as a derivative of his or her spouse [52] if necessary to overcome any applicable adjustment bars, or may adjust under INA 245(a) (if eligible). [53] The following chart provides a summary of when the spouse or child of a grandfathered derivative beneficiary of a qualifying immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application may be eligible to accompany or follow-to-join under INA 245(i). 245(i) Adjustment Eligibility of Grandfathered Derivative Beneficiary’s Spouse or Child When Was Relationship Established? Eligible as an Accompanying or Following-to-Join Applicant? Before grandfathered derivative beneficiary adjusts status Yes, if relationship continues to exist and derivative beneficiary remains an LPR [54] After grandfathered derivative beneficiary adjusts status E. Physical Presence Requirement If claiming to be a grandfathered alien based on a qualifying petition or application that was filed after January 14, 1998, the applicant must show that the principal beneficiary of the petition or application was physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000 to adjust under INA 245(i) [55] Because this physical presence requirement applies only to the principal beneficiary, the physical presence of any derivative beneficiaries on December 21, 2000 is not relevant. Grandfathered derivative beneficiaries, however, must show that the grandfathered principal beneficiary was physically present on December 21, 2000, if the qualifying petition or application was filed after January 14, 1998. The physical presence requirement does not apply to applicants who qualify for INA 245(i) based on immigrant visa petitions and permanent labor certification applications filed on or before January 14, 1998. Example: Principal Beneficiary Date Event June 1, 1999 An alien enters the United States without inspection. April 30, 2001 A 3rd preference Petition for Alien Relative ( Form I-130 ) is properly filed on behalf of the alien and which was approvable when filed. In this example, the applicant is the principal beneficiary of a qualifying petition. Since the petition was filed after January 14, 1998, the alien must show that he or she was physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000, to be a grandfathered alien and adjust under INA 245(i) Example: Derivative Beneficiary Spouse Later Divorces Date Event July 1, 1999 A married couple enter the United States without inspection. February 1, 2000 A permanent labor certification application is properly filed on behalf of one spouse and was approvable when filed. That spouse becomes the principal beneficiary of the application, and the other spouse becomes the derivative beneficiary. January 20, 2005 The married couple divorces. October 12, 2005 The derivative beneficiary remarries an LPR. The LPR files a petition for the derivative beneficiary as the spouse of an LPR. In this example, the qualifying permanent labor certification application serves to grandfather the derivative beneficiary. The fact that the principal beneficiary and the derivative beneficiary are now divorced is not relevant for INA 245(i) purposes. The derivative beneficiary is a grandfathered alien in his or her own right and eligible to seek adjustment under INA 245(i) independently of the principal beneficiary, if the principal beneficiary was physically present", "metadata": {"id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-c-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Grandfathering Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "cdb5f0e3f805f151-5"}}

[^ 9] Field offices and service centers were required to retain evidence of the mailing date as part of the record of proceeding for all immigrant visa petitions received between May 1, 2001 and May 3, 2001. INS also affixed a stamp stating “Filed Prior to 245(i) Sunset” on all immigrant visa petitions received on or after May 1, 2001 that qualified as timely filed. [^ 10] It was not uncommon for there to be a discrepancy between the date INS physically received the filing and the filing date shown in INS electronic records (the latter being the date INS processed the check or money order for payment of the filing fee). In some offices, the sheer volume of petition filings delayed recording the system filing date by up to several weeks or even months. If the applicant is a derivative grandfathered beneficiary or accompanying (or following-to-join) spouse or child, an officer may need to resolve any discrepancy in the filing date by reviewing the principal grandfathered beneficiary’s A-file.

In contrast, grandfathered derivative beneficiaries only need to establish the qualifying relationship existed at the time the qualifying petition or labor certification application was properly filed. This is a unique aspect of INA 245(i) adjustment. Grandfathered derivative beneficiaries do not need to show the qualifying relationship continues to exist at the time they seek adjustment unless they are adjusting as an accompanying or following-to-join spouse or child of the principal beneficiary.

{"text": "Chapter 3 - Eligibility and Filing Requirements A. Adjustment Eligibility under INA 245(i) Grandfathered aliens and their current spouse and children are eligible to adjust under INA 245(i) if they meet certain eligibility requirements. INA 245(i) Adjustment of Status Eligibility Requirements The applicant must be included in the categories of restricted aliens under regulation. [1] The applicant must properly file: Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( Form I-485 ), and Adjustment of Status Under Section 245(i) ( Form I-485 Supplement A [2] The applicant must pay the additional $1,000 statutory sum (unless exempt). [3] The applicant is physically present in the United States at the time of filing Form I-485 and Supplement A. The applicant is a grandfathered alien or is the current spouse or child of a grandfathered alien. If the qualifying petition or application was filed between January 14, 1998 and April 30, 2001, the principal beneficiary was physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000. The applicant is eligible for an immigrant visa as the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition or by qualifying under certain other immigrant categories. The applicant has an immigrant visa immediately available at the time he or she files Form I-485 and at the time USCIS approves the applicant’s Form I-485 and Supplement A. The applicant is admissible to the United States or is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief. The applicant merits the favorable exercise of discretion. [4] B. Filing the Adjustment Application 1. Form I-485 Application and Supplement A Applicants seeking adjustment of status under INA 245(i) must file both: Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( Form I-485 ) with appropriate filing fee, and Adjustment of Status Under Section 245(i) ( Form I-485 Supplement A ) with payment of the $1,000 sum (unless exempt). [5] Each applicant must file a separate Form I-485 and Supplement A (if applying under 245(i)) regardless of whether the applicant is a grandfathered beneficiary or spouse or child accompanying (or following-to-join) a grandfathered beneficiary. Applicants must complete the form and Supplement A according to the form instructions. [6] If the applicant is required to pay the $1,000 statutory sum, the applicant must do so before USCIS adjudicates the Form I-485. [7] The statutory sum is an absolute statutory eligibility requirement, is not a fee, and may not be waived. INA 245(i) only applies to adjustment applications filed on or after the original date of enactment on October 1, 1994. [8] INA 245(i) does not apply to: Any adjustment application filed before October 1, 1994; or Any motions to reopen or reconsider an adjustment application filed before October 1, 1994. [9] If USCIS denies an adjustment application filed prior to October 1, 1994, the applicant may file a new adjustment application to seek 245(i) benefits. [10] The burden always remains on an applicant applying to adjust under INA 245(i) to satisfy all filing requirements, including the filing of the Supplement A and paying the additional sum. While 8 CFR 245.10(d) requires the agency to issue a notice of intent to deny where an applicant, who appears eligible under 245(i), has filed an application for adjustment without either the Supplement A or the additional sum, this regulation only applies to those applications that were pending on the effective date of the regulation, March 26, 2001. [11] Therefore, notice under 8 CFR 245.10(d) was only required for those applicants who appeared to be eligible for INA 245(i) at that time. That regulation (8 CFR 245.10(d)) does not require USCIS to issue a notice of intent to deny an applicant who has applied for adjustment of status under INA 245(a) after March 26, 2001. 2. Filing by Grandfathered Beneficiaries Grandfathered beneficiaries (whether principal or derivative) eligible to adjust under INA 245(i) may file Supplement A and pay the $1,000 sum, if required, either: At the same time as Form I-485; or Any time after filing Form I-485 while it remains pending. [12] Applicants who file Supplement A after their Form I-485 should attach a copy of the Notice of Action (Form I-797) (fee receipt) for the pending Form I-485. 3. Filing by Family Members of Grandfathered Beneficiaries The current spouse or child (unmarried and under 21 years of age) of a grandfathered beneficiary (whether principal or derivative) eligible to accompany or follow-to-join [13] that beneficiary may file Form I-485: Together with the principal applicant’s Form I-485; At any time while the principal applicant’s previously-filed Form I-485 remains pending; or At any time after the principal applicant became a lawful permanent resident (LPR), provided the applicant’s relationship as the principal applicant’s spouse or child existed at the time the principal applicant became an LPR (and provided the principal applicant remains in LPR status).

It may be more difficult for an applicant to obtain documents from the original petitioning employer or family member with the passage of time. In many cases, however, applicants are able to obtain employment or legal documents through a state or county business licensing board, secretary of state’s office or state labor board, and other public records. An officer should consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a petition was “approvable when filed.” USCIS makes this determination based on the circumstances that existed at the time the petition was filed. A petition that was approvable when filed but was later withdrawn, denied, or revoked due to circumstances that arose after the time of filing may still qualify the applicant for 245(i) adjustment if he or she is otherwise eligible. [16] 2. Proof of Qualifying Labor Certification Application An applicant can generally prove the existence of a qualifying permanent labor certification application [17] by submitting a copy of the Application for Alien Labor Certification (ETA Form 750) showing the principal beneficiary’s name and bearing a state workforce agency’s date stamp, an agency letter, or other official DOL document specifying the date of receipt or filing. The following table outlines documentary evidence an applicant may submit to satisfy the three requirements to prove he or she has a qualifying permanent labor certification application. Proof of Qualifying Labor Certification Application Requirement Documentary Evidence [18] Filing Deadline Beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application Form ETA 750 Receipt from DOL or a State Wage Authority (SWA) for a Form ETA 750 On or before April 30, 2001 Application was “properly filed” Receipt from DOL or SWA dated no later than April 30, 2001 On or before April 30, 2001 Application was “approvable when filed” Evidence that application was accepted for filing (including receipt notice from DOL or SWA) and no evidence of fraud or ineligibility On or before April 30, 2001 3. Proof of Physical Presence Applicants whose INA 245(i) adjustment applications are based on a qualifying immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application filed after January 14, 1998, must prove that the principal beneficiary of that petition or application was physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000. [19] In some cases, a single document may suffice to prove physical presence, but often applicants must submit several documents. USCIS ordinarily places the greatest weight on federal, state, or municipal government-issued documents. Examples of documents that applicants may submit copies of as evidence of physical presence include but are not limited to: Arrival-Departure Record (Form I-94); Nonimmigrant visa page from passport; Authorization for Parole of an", "metadata": {"id": "3c441a21ceae1e3f", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-c-chapter-4", "title": "Chapter 4 - Documentation and Evidence | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "3c441a21ceae1e3f-1"}}

Proof of Physical Presence Applicants whose INA 245(i) adjustment applications are based on a qualifying immigrant visa petition or permanent labor certification application filed after January 14, 1998, must prove that the principal beneficiary of that petition or application was physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000. [19] In some cases, a single document may suffice to prove physical presence, but often applicants must submit several documents. USCIS ordinarily places the greatest weight on federal, state, or municipal government-issued documents. Examples of documents that applicants may submit copies of as evidence of physical presence include but are not limited to: Arrival-Departure Record (Form I-94); Nonimmigrant visa page from passport; Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-512L) or other U.S. government-issued document showing parole into the United States after inspection by an immigration officer; Notice to Appear in Immigration Court; Official correspondence or other notices from a U.S. government agency; A state driver’s license; Income tax or property tax records, returns, or payments; School or college transcripts and records; Medical records; Lease agreements and rental receipts; Utility bill receipts; or Employment records, such as payroll records or pay stubs. [20] Applicants who submit a personal affidavit attesting to physical presence must also submit documentation in support of the affidavit. [21] USCIS evaluates all documentation on a case-by-case basis. [22] D. Demonstrating Underlying Basis for Adjustment Applicants for INA 245(i) adjustment must be eligible for an immigrant visa under a family-based, employment-based, special immigrant, or diversity visa immigrant category. The applicant may adjust based on: The qualifying immigrant visa petition used to establish grandfathering, if the petition is still valid; The immigrant visa petition associated with the permanent labor certification application used to establish grandfathering, if the petition is still valid; A separate immigrant visa petition; or Selection in the diversity visa program. For instance, an applicant may be a grandfathered alien based on a permanent labor certification application but ultimately adjust status through a petition filed on his or her behalf by his or her lawful permanent resident (LPR) spouse. [23] Eligibility requirements vary depending on the immigrant visa category under which an applicant seeks to adjust. An officer should review the record for proof that the applicant is eligible for an immigrant visa in the category that forms the basis for the applicant’s adjustment. The Form I-485 instructions and the other category-specific parts of this volume provide detailed information on documentation and evidence applicants must submit with Form I-485, depending on their specific basis for adjustment. E. Proof of Family Relationship Applicants seeking INA 245(i) adjustment as a grandfathered derivative beneficiary [24] must show that the required relationship to the grandfathered principal beneficiary existed at the time the qualifying petition or application was properly filed. Grandfathered derivative beneficiaries do not, however, need to show that the relationship continues to exist at the time they file the adjustment application. Applicants seeking adjustment as an accompanying (or following-to-join) spouse or child of a grandfathered beneficiary (who is the principal adjustment applicant) must show the spouse or child relationship currently exists. [25] Such applicants must also demonstrate that the grandfathered beneficiary is currently applying for, has already applied for, or was granted adjustment of status under INA 245(i) and remains an LPR. An applicant can generally prove the required relationship by submitting a marriage certificate (for spouse) or birth certificate or adoption decree (for child). An applicant can generally prove the grandfathered beneficiary is applying for or was granted adjustment of status by submitting a copy of the Approval Notice or Receipt (Form I-797) for that Form I-485, or a copy of the permanent resident card (Form I-551), if applicable. F. Admissibility Like other applicants for adjustment of status, INA 245(i) applicants must establish that they are admissible to the United States. Because a fundamental aspect of INA 245(i) is to permit certain aliens to adjust status despite entry without inspection, the ground of inadmissibility related to aliens present in the United States without inspection and admission or inspection and parole does not apply to these applicants. [26] INA 245(i), however, does not protect applicants from other inadmissibility grounds. If an officer determines that an applicant is inadmissible, then the applicant is ineligible for 245(i) adjustment unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or some other form of relief from all applicable grounds of inadmissibility. G. Relief from Adjustment Bars In general, applicants are ineligible for adjustment of status under INA 245(a) if any of the statutory adjustment bars apply to them. [27] INA 245(i) exempts eligible applicants from most of the INA 245(c) bars [28] to adjustment of status.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose The medical grounds of inadmissibility, the medical examination of aliens, and the vaccinations administered to aliens are designed to protect the health of the United States population. The immigration medical examination, the resulting medical examination report, and the vaccination record provide the information USCIS uses to determine if an applicant meets the health-related standards for admissibility. Four basic medical conditions may make an applicant inadmissible on health-related grounds: Communicable disease of public health significance, Failure to show proof of required vaccinations, Physical or mental disorder with associated harmful behavior, and Drug abuse or addiction. B. Background Public health concerns have been reflected in U.S. immigration law since the Immigration Act of 1882. [1] Among others, “persons suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease” were not allowed to enter the United States. [2] In 1990, Congress revised and consolidated all of the grounds of inadmissibility. It narrowed health-related grounds of inadmissibility to include only aliens with communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders with associated harmful behavior, or those with drug abuse or addiction problems. [3] As of 1996, Congress requires all immigrant visa and adjustment of status applicants to establish that they have been vaccinated against certain vaccine-preventable diseases. [4] C. Role of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Because medical knowledge and public health concerns can and do change over time, Congress gave the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to designate by regulations which conditions make an alien inadmissible on health-related grounds. The HHS component charged with defining these medical conditions is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC’s responsibilities include: Publishing regulations addressing health-related conditions that render an applicant inadmissible; Establishing the medical examination requirements in its Technical Instructions for Medical Examination of Aliens (Technical Instructions) that are binding on civil surgeons in the United States, panel physicians overseas, USCIS officers, and State Department consular officers; [5] Responding to medical questions that officers, civil surgeons, and panel physicians may have based on the Technical Instructions; [6] and Advising USCIS on the adjudication of medical waivers. D. Role of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Congress authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to determine an alien’s admissibility to the United States, which includes determinations based on health reasons. [7] DHS must follow HHS regulations and instructions when determining whether an applicant is inadmissible on health-related grounds. [8] Congress also empowers DHS to designate qualified physicians as civil surgeons who conduct medical examinations of aliens physically present in the United States. [9] E. Making a Health-Related Inadmissibility Determination To make a health-related inadmissibility determination, the officer should follow the steps outlined below: Overview of Process of Making a Health-Related Inadmissibility Determination Step of Adjudication Where can I find ​information ​on this step? Step 1: Is the applicant subject to the health-related grounds of inadmissibility or is there another reason that requires the applicant to undergo an immigration medical examination? Chapter 3, Applicability of Medical Examination and Vaccination Requirement [ 8 USCIS-PM B.3 Step 2: If required, has the applicant been medically examined by the appropriate physician and is the appropriate medical documentation in the file? Chapter 3, Applicability of Medical Examination and Vaccination Requirement [ 8 USCIS-PM B.3 Step 3: Was the medical documentation [10] properly completed and is it still valid? Chapter 4, Review of Medical Examination Documentation [ 8 USCIS-PM B.4 ] through Chapter 10, Other Medical Conditions [ 8 USCIS-PM B.10 Step 4: Is the applicant inadmissible based on the health-related grounds? Chapter 11, Inadmissibility Determination [ 8 USCIS-PM B.11 Step 5: Is the applicant inadmissible based on grounds other than the health-related grounds, as evidenced by the medical documentation?

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Medical Examination and Vaccination Record A. Purpose of the Medical Examination and Vaccination Report The results of the medical examination and vaccination record determine whether an applicant is inadmissible on health-related grounds. The medical examination documentation indicates whether the applicant has either a Class A or Class B medical condition and the vaccination record shows whether the applicant has complied with all vaccination requirements. B. Class A and B Conditions and Their Impact on Admissibility Class A and B conditions are defined in Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)regulations. [1] Class A conditions are medical conditions that render an alien inadmissible and ineligible for a visa or adjustment of status. [2] A Class A medical condition is a: Communicable disease of public health significance per HHS regulation; A failure to present documentation of having received vaccinations against vaccine-preventable diseases; [3] Present or past physical or mental disorder with associated harmful behavior or harmful behavior that is likely to recur; and Drug abuse or addiction. Class B conditions are defined as physical or mental health conditions, diseases, or disability serious in degree or permanent in nature. [4] This may be a medical condition that, although not rendering an applicant inadmissible, represents a departure from normal health or well-being that may be significant enough to: Interfere with the applicant’s ability to care for himself or herself, to attend school, or to work; or Require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization in the future. C. Completion of a Medical Examination When a medical examination is required to determine the applicant’s admissibility, the alien must be examined by a physician who is designated to perform this examination. By statute, any medical officer in the U.S. Public Health Service may conduct the examination. However, this rarely occurs. Most medical examinations are conducted by a physician designated as a civil surgeon by USCIS [5] or designated as a panel physician abroad by the U.S. Department of State (DOS). Civil surgeons complete medical examinations for applicants in the United States, while panel physicians complete medical examinations for immigrant visa and refugee applicants seeking immigration benefits from outside the United States. Footnotes [^ 1] See 42 CFR 34.2 [^ 2] Class A conditions are medical conditions mentioned in INA 212(a)(1)(A) . See 42 CFR 34.2(d) [^ 3] This Class A medical condition only applies to aliens who seek admission as immigrants, or who seek adjustment of status to one lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Additionally, a child who is adopted and under the age of 10 years or younger is not deemed to have a Class A condition if the following conditions apply: Prior to the admission of the child, an adoptive parent or prospective adoptive parent of the child, who has sponsored the child for admission as an immediate relative, has executed an affidavit stating that the parent is aware of the vaccination requirement , and will ensure that, within 30 days of the child’s admission, or at the earliest time that is medically appropriate, the child will receive the vaccinations required for immigration purposes.

{"text": "Chapter 3 - Applicability of Medical Examination and Vaccination Requirement A. Requirements by Benefit Type Medical examination and vaccination requirements vary depending on the immigration benefit the person is seeking. Most applicants subject to medical grounds of inadmissibility must undergo a medical examination to determine their admissibility. Some applicants, however, do not need to undergo a medical examination unless there is a specific concern. Nonimmigrants, for example, are in this category. Even if the applicant is not subject to health-related grounds of inadmissibility, the officer may still order a medical examination as a matter of discretion if the evidence indicates that there may be a public health concern. [1] This could apply, for example, when an officer adjudicates a request for parole. [2] In general, an immigration officer may order a medical examination of an applicant at any time, if the officer is concerned that the applicant may be medically inadmissible. [3] This rule applies regardless of the type of immigration benefit sought, or whether the applicant is applying for a visa, seeking entry at a U.S. port-of-entry, or already in the United States. A civil surgeon in the United States can only perform a medical examination for purposes of a benefits application processed within the United States. Similarly, a panel physician abroad can generally only perform a medical examination for purposes of a visa application processed outside the United States. There are limited exceptions where an applicant seeking a benefit application inside the United States does not have to repeat a medical examination performed by a panel physician. The following chart highlights the benefits that require a medical examination and vaccinations, and whether a civil surgeon or panel physician should conduct the medical examination. [4] Medical Examination and Vaccination Requirements by Benefit Type Benefit Type Medical Examination (Yes or No) Vaccination (Yes or No) Panel Physician or Civil Surgeon Immigrant visa applicants, applying with U.S. Department of State (DOS) Yes Panel physician Adjustment applicants (other than exceptions noted elsewhere in this table) Yes Civil surgeon Nonimmigrant visa applicants, applying with DOS; and nonimmigrants seeking change/extension of status while in the United States [5] No (with some exceptions) [6] N/A Temporary Protected Status (TPS) applicants [7] No (with some exceptions) [8] N/A K or V visa applicants, applying with DOS [9] Yes Panel physician Nonimmigrant seeking change of status to V status [10] Yes Civil surgeon K or V nonimmigrants applying for adjustment of status in the United States [11] May be required [12] Yes Panel physician and/or civil surgeon Refugee applicants, including principal and derivative applicants overseas [13] Yes Panel physician Applicants seeking derivative refugee or derivative asylee status while in the United States [14] N/A Principal asylum applicants in the United States [15] N/A Applicants seeking derivative asylee status with DOS [16] Yes Panel physician Refugee-based adjustment applicants [17] May be required [18] Yes Civil surgeon [19] Asylees applying for adjustment of status [20] May be required [21] Yes Civil surgeon Kurdish asylees paroled under Operation Pacific Haven applying for adjustment of status Yes Panel physician or civil surgeon Registry applicants N/A North American Indians entering the United States [22] N/A Children of returning residents entering the United States [23] or children of U.S. nationals N/A Internationally adopted orphans [24] Yes (exception available) Panel physician Afghan nationals who arrived in the United States under Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) applying for adjustment of status Yes Panel physician or civil surgeon B. Special Considerations 1. Nonimmigrants and TPS Applicants In general, nonimmigrant visa applicants, nonimmigrants seeking change or extension of status, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) applicants are only medically examined if the consular officer or immigration officer has concerns as to the applicant’s inadmissibility on health-related grounds. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at ports-of-entry may also require a nonimmigrant arriving with or without a visa to submit to a medical examination to determine whether a medical ground of inadmissibility applies. 2. K or V Visa Applicants Applying with DOS [25] While the consular officer may encourage compliance, the consular officer cannot deny a K or V visa for lack of compliance with the vaccination requirements. Some panel physicians may perform the vaccination assessment in anticipation of the applicant’s later adjustment of status application. 3. Nonimmigrants Applying for Change of Status to V Status For nonimmigrants applying for change of status to V status, the civil surgeon may perform the vaccination assessment in anticipation of the applicant’s later adjustment of status application. 4.

Some panel physicians may perform the vaccination assessment in anticipation of the applicant’s later adjustment of status application. 3. Nonimmigrants Applying for Change of Status to V Status For nonimmigrants applying for change of status to V status, the civil surgeon may perform the vaccination assessment in anticipation of the applicant’s later adjustment of status application. 4. K or V Nonimmigrants Applying for Adjustment [26] K and V nonimmigrants applying for adjustment of status are not required to repeat the medical examination if the application was filed within one year of the date of the original medical examination, and: The medical examination did not reveal a Class A medical condition; or The applicant received a conditional waiver in conjunction with the K or V nonimmigrant visa or the change of status to V and the applicant submits evidence of compliance with the waiver terms and conditions. [27] If a new medical examination is required and reveals a Class A medical condition, a new waiver application will also be required. In such cases, the officer should determine whether the applicant complied with the terms and conditions of the first waiver, if applicable. Such determination should be given considerable weight in the adjudication of a subsequent waiver application. [28] Even if a new medical examination is not required, applicants must still comply with the vaccination requirements if the vaccination record was not included as part of the original medical examination report. If the vaccination report was properly completed at the time of the overseas examination, the officer may accept the vaccination assessment completed by the panel physician. An applicant’s overseas medical examination report completed by a panel physician should already be in the applicant’s A-file. If it is not in the A-file, the officer should request the medical examination report through a Request for Evidence (RFE). If the applicant was granted a change of status to V in the United States, [29] the medical examination report completed by the civil surgeon should be in the A-file created at the time that the change of status was initially granted. 5. Refugees Applying for Adjustment [30] By regulation, refugees applying for adjustment of status generally do not need to repeat the entire medical examination if the applicant was already examined by a panel physician for purposes of admission to the United States. [31] Refugees must undergo an additional medical examination only if the original examination by the panel physician revealed a Class A medical condition. Family members granted refugee status in the United States must submit to a medical examination at the time they seek to adjust their status. All refugees must comply with the vaccination requirements at the time of adjustment of status by submitting the relevant parts of the Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record ( Form I-693 ) completed by a designated civil surgeon. A prior vaccination assessment performed by the panel physician cannot be used for purposes of the adjustment of status application. [32] USCIS granted a blanket civil surgeon designation to state and local health department physicians for the limited purpose of completing the vaccination record for refugees applying for adjustment of status. 6. Asylees Applying for Adjustment All asylees are required to undergo an immigration medical exam, including vaccination assessment, at time of adjustment. [33] However, according to USCIS policy developed in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an asylee dependent who had a medical examination conducted overseas is not required to undergo a new medical exam when applying for adjustment of status if: The results of the overseas medical examination are contained in the A-file and no Class A condition was reported; The asylee has applied for adjustment of status within one year of eligibility to file; and No evidence in the A-file or testimony given at the interview suggests that the asylee has acquired a Class A condition after his or her entry into the United States. Even if an asylee dependent may use the result of the previous examination, he or she must still establish compliance with the vaccination requirements and submit the vaccination assessment with his or her adjustment of status application. This requirement applies even if the applicant had a vaccination assessment completed overseas by a panel physician. To comply with the requirement, the applicant must have the relevant parts of Form I-693 completed by the civil surgeon. 7. Certain Afghan Nationals Applying for Adjustment of Status After Arriving in the United States During Operation Allies Welcome Certain Afghan nationals who arrived in the United States during OAW and completed a qualifying immigration medical examination are not required to repeat the immigration medical examination when applying for adjustment of status, provided they meet the following conditions: The Afghan national completed a", "metadata": {"id": "27cb420272731677", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8-part-b-chapter-3", "title": "Chapter 3 - Applicability of Medical Examination and Vaccination Requirement | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "27cb420272731677-1"}}

Certain Afghan Nationals Applying for Adjustment of Status After Arriving in the United States During Operation Allies Welcome Certain Afghan nationals who arrived in the United States during OAW and completed a qualifying immigration medical examination are not required to repeat the immigration medical examination when applying for adjustment of status, provided they meet the following conditions: The Afghan national completed a full immigration medical examination abroad, or at a government-run facility in the United States; A panel physician conducted the immigration medical examination abroad and annotated the results on DS-7794 or DS-2054, and related worksheets, or a blanket-designated civil surgeon conducted the immigration medical examination in the United States at a government-run facility in the United States and annotated the results on Form I-693; The results of the immigration medical examination are contained in the A-file or USCIS systems and no Class A medical condition was reported; and No evidence in the A-file, USCIS systems, or testimony given at the interview suggests that the applicant has acquired a Class A medical condition after completing their immigration medical examination. Additionally, in consultation with CDC, USCIS has determined that Afghan nationals who meet the above conditions may use their immigration medical examination to show they are not inadmissible under the health-related grounds for the purpose of any benefit request at any time in the future. 8. Children of Returning Residents Entering the United States [34] For children of returning residents entering the United States, as long as the parent’s visa is valid or the parent is a U.S. resident or U.S. national, there are no medical examination or vaccination requirements. Children of returning residents entering the United States are: Children born abroad after the parent has been issued an immigrant visa and while the parent is applying for admission to the United States. Children born abroad during the temporary visit abroad of a mother who is a national or permanent resident of the United States. 9. Internationally Adopted Orphans [35] Children 10 years of age or younger who are classified as orphans and who are applying for IR-3 and IR-4 (orphans) and IH-3 and IH-4 (Hague Convention adoptees) visas are not required to comply with the vaccination requirements before admission to the United States.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose Certain aliens may not be allowed to enter or obtain status in the United States because they are inadmissible. These aliens may overcome the inadmissibility if they are eligible to apply for and receive a waiver. USCIS, in its administration of waiver laws and policies, seeks to: Promote family unity and provide humanitarian results; Provide relief to refugees, asylees, victims of human trafficking [1] and certain criminal acts, [2] and other humanitarian and public interest applicants who seek protection or permanent residency in the United States; Advance the national interest by allowing aliens to be admitted to the United States if such admission could benefit the welfare of the country; Ensure public health and safety concerns are met by requiring that applicants satisfy all medical requirements prior to admission or, if admitted, seek any necessary treatment; and Weigh public safety and national security concerns against the social and humanitarian benefits of granting admission to an alien. Considerations of family unity, humanitarian concerns, public and national interest, and national security may differ depending on the specific waiver an applicant is seeking. ​B. Background With the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), [3] Congress established a variety of inadmissibility grounds to protect the interests of the United States. Congress considered waivers as a special remedy to the grounds of inadmissibility. [4] Congress later amended the INA in 1957, easing many stricter provisions of the earlier legislation. [5] For example, it allowed certain alien relatives of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents (LPR) to apply for and obtain a waiver of certain grounds of exclusion or deportation (now inadmissibility or removal). [6] When passing the 1957 amendments, Congress created exceptions to many strict provisions from the 1952 Act to promote family unity. For Congress, in many circumstances, it was more important to keep families together than to stringently enforce inadmissibility grounds. [7] Congress tightened waiver requirements and availability once again with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). [8] For example, IIRIRA made waivers of criminal inadmissibility [9] unavailable to LPRs who were convicted of an aggravated felony or who had not continuously resided in the United States for at least 7 years before initiation of removal proceedings. IIRIRA also created new inadmissibility grounds, such as the ground of inadmissibility on account of unlawful presence, and corresponding waivers. C.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Forms of Relief A. Waivers In general, applicants for immigration benefits must establish that they are admissible to the United States. If an applicant for an immigration benefit is inadmissible to the United States, USCIS may only grant the benefit if the applicant receives a waiver of inadmissibility or another form of relief provided in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). [1] In general, if the INA uses the term waiver, the applicant must apply for the waiver by filing the correct application. USCIS may only grant a waiver if the applicant meets all statutory and regulatory requirements. There are instances in which an officer may adjudicate a waiver without asking the applicant to file a form. For example, an officer may adjudicate certain waivers of inadmissibility for a refugee or an asylee seeking adjustment of status without the applicant filing a waiver application. In these circumstances, the officer must still clearly document the waiver determination in the record. B. Exceptions or Exemptions A statute may provide for an exception or exemption from a ground of inadmissibility. [2] If the alien’s action or circumstance meets the requirements of an exception or exemption, then the ground of inadmissibility does not apply and the alien is not inadmissible on that ground. Unlike a waiver, an exemption or exception generally does not require that an alien file an application. C. Consent to Reapply Permission to reapply for admission into the United States after deportation or removal, also known as “consent to reapply,” is not a waiver. [3] Consent to reapply is a distinct remedy that permits an alien to seek admission. If the statute specifies that the alien must obtain consent to reapply to overcome the inadmissibility, a waiver of inadmissibility is not a substitute for consent to reapply. [4] Footnotes [^ 1] See Pub. L. 82-414 (June 27, 1952). [^ 2] Exception and exemption both mean that the specific inadmissibility ground does not apply if the applicant establishes that the terms of the exception or exemption apply. [^ 3] See Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After Deportation or Removal ( Form I-212 ) (used to seek consent to reapply). See the form instructions for more information. [^ 4] See INA 212(a)(9)(A) .

{"text": "Chapter 3 - Review of Inadmissibility Grounds A. Verification of Inadmissibility Before adjudicating a waiver, the officer must verify that the applicant is inadmissible. [1] The officer must identify all inadmissibility grounds that apply, even if an immigration judge, a consular officer, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer, or a different USCIS officer made a prior inadmissibility determination. [2] An applicant’s file should reflect evidence of inadmissibility. Examples of evidence that may indicate an applicant is inadmissible may include but is not limited to:​ A visa refusal worksheet; Background check results; A criminal disposition; A sworn statement; and A Record of Arrests and Prosecutions sheet (police arrest record). If the officer identifies that the applicant is inadmissible, the officer should then determine whether a waiver or other type of relief is available and whether the applicant meets the eligibility requirements for the relief. [3] B. Grounds Included in Waiver Application The officer must review all inadmissibility grounds that the applicant lists in the waiver application. If the applicant states that he or she is inadmissible but there is no evidence of inadmissibility in the record, then the officer should issue a Request for Evidence (RFE). The officer should request that the applicant provide a written statement explaining why the applicant thinks he or she is inadmissible. The officer should proceed with the waiver adjudication if the officer determines that the applicant is inadmissible. An applicant may file a waiver application after another government agency, such as the Department of State or CBP, has found the applicant inadmissible. In general, USCIS accepts another government agency’s finding of inadmissibility. The officer should only question another government agency’s inadmissibility determination if: The government agency’s finding was clearly erroneous; or The applicant has shown that he or she is clearly not inadmissible. The officer should work with the other government agency to resolve the issue through appropriate procedures. C. Grounds Not Included in Waiver Application If the officer identifies additional inadmissibility grounds based on events that are not included in the waiver application, the officer should notify the applicant and the applicant’s representative, if applicable. The officer should follow current USCIS guidance on the issuance of RFEs, Notices of Intent to Deny (NOID), and Denials.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose This part offers guidance concerning the adjudication of applications for those discretionary waivers of inadmissibility that require applicants to establish that refusal of their admission would result in “extreme hardship” to certain U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) family members. B. Background Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), [1] admissibility is generally a requirement for admission to the United States, adjustment of status, and other immigration benefits. [2] The grounds that make aliens inadmissible to the United States are generally described in section 212 of the INA. Several statutory provisions authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security [3] to grant discretionary waivers of particular grounds of inadmissibility for those who demonstrate that a denial of admission would result in “extreme hardship” to specified U.S. citizen or LPR family members. These specified family members are known as “qualifying relatives.” [4] Each of these statutory provisions conditions a waiver on both a finding of extreme hardship to one or more qualifying relatives and the favorable exercise of discretion. These waiver applications are adjudicated by USCIS (and in some cases by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review). [5] The various statutory waiver provisions specify different categories of qualifying relatives and permit waivers of different inadmissibility grounds. The provisions include: INA 212(a)(9)(B)(v) – Provides for waiver of the 3- and 10-year inadmissibility bars for unlawful presence. [6] Qualifying relatives are limited to applicants’ U.S. citizen and LPR spouses and parents. [7] INA 212(h)(1)(B) [8] – Provides for waiver of inadmissibility based on crimes involving moral turpitude, multiple criminal convictions, prostitution and commercialized vice, and certain serious criminal offenses for which the alien received immunity from prosecution. [9] Also provides a waiver of inadmissibility for a controlled substance violation insofar as the violation relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana. [10] Qualifying relatives are limited to applicants’ U.S. citizen and LPR spouses, parents, sons, and daughters. [11] INA 212(i)(1) – Provides for waiver of inadmissibility for certain types of immigration fraud or willful misrepresentations of material fact. [12] For purposes of this waiver: Qualifying relatives are generally limited to applicants’ U.S. citizen and LPR spouses and parents. But if the applicant is a Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioner, USCIS also must consider extreme hardship to the applicant himself or herself, or to a parent or child [13] who is a U.S. citizen, LPR, or otherwise a qualified alien. The factors discussed in this guidance apply to any waiver application in which the applicant must establish extreme hardship to a qualifying relative. [14] Because the classes of individuals who may serve as qualifying relatives varies among the different waiver provisions, officers should carefully determine which individuals can serve as qualifying relatives under the relevant extreme hardship analysis. Footnotes [^ 1] See Immigration and Nationality Act, Pub. L. 82-414 , 66 Stat. 163 (June 27, 1952), as amended. [^ 2] See INA 212(a) and INA 245(a) [^ 3] See 6 U.S.C. 271(b) . See Delegation No. 0150.1, “Delegation to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services” II, Z (June 5, 2003). [^ 4] The classes of individuals who may serve as “qualifying relatives” depends on the specific text of the waiver provision involved. A U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent is a qualifying relative for most extreme hardship waivers. For certain other extreme hardship waivers, a U.S. citizen or LPR child, as well as an adult son or daughter, can be the qualifying relative. In the case of a K visa applicant, a U.S. citizen fiancé(e) is considered a U.S. citizen “spouse” qualifying relative. See 8 CFR 212.7(a) and 22 CFR 41.81(d) (K nonimmigrants). Finally, under some provisions, discretionary relief may be available upon a showing of extreme hardship to the applicants themselves. These include waivers of inadmissibility under INA 212(i)(1) (waiver of fraud-related inadmissibility for Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioners), waivers of requirements for removing conditions on LPR status under INA 216(c)(4)(A) , cancellation of removal under INA 240A(b)(2)(A)(v) adjudicated by the Executive Office for Immigration Review, and suspension of removal and cancellation of removal under Section 203 of Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central America Relief Act (NACARA), Pub. L. 105-100 (PDF) , 111 Stat. 2160, 2196 (November 19, 1997). See 8 CFR 240.64(c) and 8 CFR 1240.64(c) . This guidance addresses USCIS’ adjudication of waiver applications that require a showing of extreme hardship to specified family members, not applications based on extreme hardship to applicants themselves. [^ 5] See 6 U.S.C. 271(b) . See Delegation No. 0150.1, “Delegation to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services” II, Z (June 5, 2003).

See Matter of Monreal-Aguinaga (PDF) , 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001). This guidance specifically applies only to “extreme hardship” determinations.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Extreme Hardship Policy A. Overview Waivers of inadmissibility generally authorize U.S. immigration authorities to balance competing policy considerations when determining whether an alien should be admitted to the United States despite his or her inadmissibility. On the one hand, the alien has engaged in conduct that Congress considers serious enough to render the individual inadmissible to the United States. On the other hand, Congress specifically authorized waivers of these grounds of inadmissibility for those cases in which the refusal of admission “would result in extreme hardship.” To meet this “extreme hardship” requirement, the applicant must show that refusal of admission would impose more than the usual level of hardship that commonly results from family separation or relocation. Congress clearly intended the waiver to be applied for purposes of family unity and with other humanitarian concerns in mind. [1] B. What is Extreme Hardship The term “extreme hardship” is not expressly defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations, or in case law (although DHS regulations and certain Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decisions have provided some relevant guidance with respect to what may constitute extreme hardship in certain contexts). As the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in INS v. Jong Ha Wang, “[t]hese words are not self-explanatory, and reasonable men could easily differ as to their construction. But the [INA] commits their definition in the first instance to the Attorney General [and the Secretary of Homeland Security] and [their] delegates.” [2] Therefore, “[t]he Attorney General [and the Secretary of Homeland Security] and [their] delegates have the authority to construe ‘extreme hardship’ narrowly should they deem it wise to do so.” [3] Conversely, “[a] restrictive view of extreme hardship is not mandated either by the Supreme Court or by [the BIA] case law.” [4] USCIS recognizes that at least some degree of hardship to qualifying relatives exists in most, if not all, cases in which individuals with the requisite relationships are denied admission. Importantly, to be considered “extreme,” the hardship must exceed that which is usual or expected. [5] But extreme hardship need not be unique, [6] nor is the standard as demanding as the statutory “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” standard that is generally applicable to non-lawful permanent resident cancellation of removal. [7] Footnotes [^ 1] For example, see Matter of Lopez-Monzon (PDF) , 17 I&N Dec. 280, 281 (BIA 1979) (“The intent of Congress in adding [the INA 212(i) waiver], which is evident from its language, was to provide for the unification of families, thereby avoiding the hardship of separation.”). [^ 2] See 450 U.S. 139, 144 (1981) (per curiam). [^ 3] See INS v. Jong Ha Wang , 450 U.S. 139, 145 (1981) (per curiam). [^ 4] See Matter of Pilch (PDF) , 21 I&N Dec. 627, 630 (BIA 1996). See Matter of L-O-G- (PDF) , 21 I&N Dec. 413, 418 (BIA 1996). [^ 5] See 8 CFR 1240.58(b) (hardship must go “beyond that typically associated with deportation”) (former suspension of deportation). The federal courts and the BIA have frequently relied on cases involving the former suspension of deportation statute when interpreting extreme hardship waiver statutes, as these statutes employed the same language. See Hassan v. INS, 927 F.2d 465, 467 (9th Cir. 1991). See Matter of Cervantes-Gonzalez (PDF) , 22 I&N Dec. 560, 565 (BIA 1999), aff’d, Cervantes-Gonzales v. INS , 244 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2001).

See Matter of Andazola-Rivas (PDF) , 23 I&N Dec. 319, 322, 324 (BIA 2002) (holding the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” standard to be “significantly more burdensome than the ‘extreme hardship’ standard” and intimating that the applicant “might well” have prevailed under the latter standard even though she failed under the former).

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose Aliens in the United States must obtain employment authorization before they may lawfully work in the country. Working without authorization may lead to a number of negative consequences, such as DHS terminating the person’s immigration status, being barred from adjusting status to lawful permanent residence, and DHS removing the person from the United States. [1] Certain aliens automatically obtain employment authorization by virtue of their immigration status. Others must affirmatively apply for employment authorization with USCIS. If USCIS approves an Application for Employment Authorization ( Form I-765 ), USCIS also issues an employment authorization document (EAD) as evidence of a person's authorization to work in the United States. B. Background In 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) [2] in an effort to deter illegal immigration to the United States. One of Congress’ strategies was to discourage unauthorized employment, which Congress concluded was a significant magnet for illegal immigration. Because of IRCA, employers must now verify the identity and eligibility of employees to work in the United States. The U.S. government imposes penalties on employers that knowingly employ persons not authorized to work in this country or that fail to comply with verification requirements. The immigration laws provide the Secretary of Homeland Security with authority to authorize employment in the United States for eligible aliens and to place restrictions and conditions on both employment authorization and endorsements evidencing such authorization. Regulations promulgated under IRCA introduced Employment Eligibility Verification ( Form I-9 ) to ensure that all employees present documentary proof to prospective employers of their eligibility to accept employment in the United States. [3] Federal law requires that every employer who recruits, refers for a fee, or hires a person for employment in the United States must complete Form I-9, which requires employers to verify the employee’s identity and employment authorization. To that end, some employers use E-Verify to conduct such verifications. [4] In implementing IRCA, legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) created the EAD to provide certain classes of aliens with evidence of their authorization to work in the United States. [5] Regulations outline which classes of aliens are automatically authorized to work in the United States by virtue of their immigration status and which classes must apply to request employment authorization. [6] C. Legal Authorities INA 103 – Powers and duties of the Secretary INA 274A – Unlawful employment 8 CFR 274a Subpart B – Employment authorization Footnotes [^ 1] DHS may terminate an alien’s immigration status if it determines the alien worked without authorization in violation of the conditions of the immigration status. See INA 237(a)(1) (violation of status as deportability ground). For more information on unlawful employment as a bar to adjustment, see Volume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part B, 245(a) Adjustment, Chapter 6, Unauthorized Employment – INA 245(c)(2) and INA 245(c)(8) [ 7 USCIS-PM B.6 ].

For information on who must complete Form I-9 , see Handbook for Employers M-274, Chapter 2, Who Must Complete Form I-9 [^ 4] E-Verify is a web-based system through which employers electronically confirm the employment eligibility of their employees. Employers enter information from an employee’s Form I-9 and E-Verify compares the information to records available to DHS and the Social Security Administration. For more information, see the E-Verify website. [^ 5] Some aliens authorized to work may be issued other documentation as evidence of employment authorization to present to employers in compliance with IRCA.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements Whether or not an alien is authorized to work in the United States depends on the alien's immigration status or circumstances. [1] The regulations outline three classes of eligibility for employment authorization: Authorization to work for any employer, as well as to engage in self-employment, based on immigration status or circumstances; [2] Authorization to work for a specific employer based on immigration status or circumstances; [3] and Authorization to work for any employer, as well as to engage in self-employment, upon approval, in the discretion of USCIS, of an Application for Employment Authorization ( Form I-765 [4] A. Authorized to Work for Any Employer Based on Status or Circumstances 1. Aliens Who Must Apply for Documentation of Employment Authorization Certain aliens are authorized to work in the United States without restriction based on their underlying immigration status or circumstances. [5] However, aliens seeking employment in the United States must present an acceptable document or combination of documents to their employer as evidence of both identity and employment authorization. [6] In general, most aliens authorized to work for any employer based on their status or circumstance must apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization. The following aliens are authorized to work in the United States without restriction, based on their status or circumstance, but generally must apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization if seeking employment in the United States: [7] Refugees; [8] Certain Afghan parolees and certain Ukrainian parolees; [9] Fiancé(e)s of U.S. citizens or children of such fiancé(e)s (K-1 or K-2 nonimmigrants); [10] Parents or dependent children of aliens granted LPR status based on being an employee of a recognized international organization (or such an employee’s family member); [11] Citizens of Palau; [12] Aliens granted withholding of deportation or removal; [13] Aliens under Deferred Enforced Departure (DED); [14] Aliens granted temporary protected status (TPS); [15] Aliens granted voluntary departure under the Family Unity Program or granted Family Unity benefits; [16] V nonimmigrants; and Aliens granted Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) resident status (employment authorization is limited to the CNMI). [17] Generally, aliens in the above categories need to submit Form I-765 to USCIS with the appropriate fee, in accordance with the form instructions, [18] to receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as evidence of such authorization if they intend to work in the United States. [19] 2. Aliens Who Do Not Need to Apply for Documentation of Employment Authorization The following aliens are authorized to work in the United States without restriction, based on their status or circumstance, and generally do not need to apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization if seeking employment in the United States because the documentation they receive showing their status or circumstance may generally also be used to show employment authorization: Lawful permanent residents (LPRs) (with or without conditions); [20] Lawful temporary residents; [21] Asylees; [22] Citizens of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands; [23] Spouses of U.S. citizens or children of such spouses (K-3 or K-4 nonimmigrants); [24] Victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons (T-1 nonimmigrants); [25] Spouses of principal E nonimmigrants; [26] Spouses of principal L-1 nonimmigrants; [27] and Victims of qualifying criminal activity (U-1 nonimmigrants) [28] and certain qualifying family members (U-2, U-3, U-4, and U-5 nonimmigrants). [29] Although these aliens are not required to apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization, they must still present acceptable evidence of identity and employment authorization when seeking employment in the United States. [30] Documentation DHS Issues as Evidence of Employment Authorization LPRs may present a Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551), a foreign passport that contains a temporary I-551 stamp, or a temporary I-551 notation on a machine-readable visa as evidence of both identity and employment authorization. [31] Asylees, spouses of U.S. citizens or children of such spouses (K-3 and K-4 nonimmigrants), victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons (T-1 nonimmigrants), spouses of E nonimmigrants (E-1S, E-2S, or E-3S nonimmigrants) with limited exceptions, [32] spouses of L nonimmigrants (L-2S nonimmigrants), and victims of qualifying criminal activity (U-1 nonimmigrants) and certain qualifying family members (U-2, U-3, U-4, and U-5 nonimmigrants) may present their Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94) [33] as acceptable evidence of employment authorization under List C of Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9) [34] However, aliens seeking employment in the United States who present their Form I-94 to an employer as evidence of employment authorization must also present a document to show evidence of identity. [35] The Form I-94 is not evidence of identity and for the categories of aliens listed above can be presented as evidence of employment authorization. To obtain a document evidencing both identity and employment authorization, these aliens may apply for an EAD, with the appropriate fee (or request a fee waiver), if", "metadata": {"id": "51662ee40d042456", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-10-part-a-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "51662ee40d042456-0"}}

However, certain categories of aliens are automatically issued an EAD showing both identity and employment authorization based on their status and are not required to apply separately for an EAD. [36] B. Authorized to Work for Specific Employer Based on Status or Circumstances The following nonimmigrants and parolees are automatically authorized to work for a specific employer based on their particular nonimmigrant status or parole: [37] Foreign government officials (A-1 or A-2 nonimmigrants), or employees of such official (A-3 nonimmigrants); [38] Foreign government officials in transit (C-2 or C-3 nonimmigrants); [39] Treaty traders (E-1 nonimmigrants) or treaty investors (E-2 nonimmigrants); [40] Students (F-1 nonimmigrants) who are seeking: [41] On-campus employment; Curricular practical training; An EAD based on a STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) extension, [42] and whose timely filed Form I-765 or successor form is pending and whose employment authorization and accompanying Form I-766 or successor form was issued based on post-completion OPT; [43] H-1B nonimmigrant status and whose duration of status and employment authorization have been extended as provided in regulations; [44] Representatives of an international organization (G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 nonimmigrants) [45] and their personal employees (G-5 nonimmigrants); [46] Temporary workers or trainees (H-1, H-2, or H-3 nonimmigrants); [47] Representatives of foreign information media (I nonimmigrants); [48] Exchange visitors (J-1 nonimmigrants); [49] Intra-company transferees (L-1 nonimmigrants); [50] \"Aliens of extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics\" (O-1 nonimmigrants), \"and an accompanying alien\" (O-2 nonimmigrants); [51] Athletes, artists, or entertainers (P-1, P-2, or P-3 nonimmigrants) and essential support personnel; [52] International cultural exchange visitors (Q-1 nonimmigrants); [53] Religious workers (R-1 nonimmigrants); [54] North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) civilian employees [55] and their personal employees; [56] United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) professionals (TN nonimmigrants); [57] Temporary workers [58] who filed a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker ( Form I-129 [59] CNMI investors (E-2 nonimmigrants); [60] CNMI transitional workers (CW-1 nonimmigrants); [61] \"Nonimmigrant treaty alien[s] in a specialty occupation\" (E-3 nonimmigrants); [62] and \"Alien[s] paroled\" as an entrepreneur for the period of authorized parole. [63] Nonimmigrants authorized to work for a specific employer based on status or circumstances are not required to file a Form I-765 to obtain authorization to work in the United States; they receive employment authorization automatically once they are admitted into the United States in, or change to, the qualifying nonimmigrant status or parole. These aliens are, however, subject to certain restrictions as a condition of their status or parole. Generally, they are only allowed to work for the employer named in their respective nonimmigrant petition or parole application and only allowed to perform the type of work specified in their petition or application. [64] Certain classes of nonimmigrants may continue their employment with the same employer for up to 240 days after the expiration of a prior authorized period of stay, provided they are the beneficiary of a timely filed petition or application for an extension of stay using the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker ( Form I-129 ) or Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status ( Form I-539 [65] C. Aliens Required to Apply for Employment Authorization The following aliens are not authorized to work incident to their immigration status or circumstance but may request employment authorization from USCIS: [66] Alien spouses or unmarried dependent children or sons or daughters of a foreign government official (A-1 or A-2 nonimmigrants) who present an endorsement from the U.S. Department of State; [67] Alien spouses or unmarried dependent sons or daughters of alien employees of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, also known as Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) (E-1 nonimmigrants); [68] Aliens in nonimmigrant student (F-1 nonimmigrant) status who: Are seeking pre-completion optional practical training, authorization to engage in up to 12 months of post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT), or a 24-month STEM OPT extension; Have been offered employment under the sponsorship of an international organization; or Are seeking employment because of severe economic hardship; [69] Alien spouses or unmarried dependent children or sons or daughters of representatives of international organization (G-1, G-3, or G-4 nonimmigrants); [70] Alien spouses or minor children", "metadata": {"id": "51662ee40d042456", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-10-part-a-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "51662ee40d042456-1"}}

{"text": "centers, see Chapter 4, Regional Center Applications [ 6 USCIS-PM G.4 ], Chapter 5, Project Applications [ 6 USCIS-PM G.5 ], and Chapter 6, Direct and Third Party Promoters [ 6 USCIS-PM G.6 The goal of the Regional Center Program is to stimulate economic growth in a specified geographic area. The regional center model can offer an immigrant investor already defined investment opportunities, thereby reducing the immigrant investor’s responsibility to identify acceptable investment vehicles. If the new commercial enterprise is located within the geographic area, and falls within the economic scope of the defined regional center, reasonable methodologies can be used to demonstrate indirect job creation. [1] A regional center can be associated with one or more new commercial enterprises. A regional center seeking to participate in the Regional Center Program must submit a proposal using the Application For Regional Center Under the Immigrant Investor Program (Form I-924). USCIS may designate a regional center based on a general proposal for the promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment. The statute further provides that a regional center shall have jurisdiction over a limited geographic area, which shall be described in the proposal and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. In addition, the establishment of a regional center may be based on general predictions, contained in the proposal, concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive capital from immigrant investors, the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such capital investments, and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have on the area. [2] The regulations state that the proposal must: Clearly describe how the regional center focuses on a geographical region of the United States and how it will promote economic growth through increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment; Provide in verifiable detail how jobs will be created directly or indirectly; Provide a detailed statement regarding the amounts and sources of capital which have been already committed to the regional center; Provide a description of the promotional efforts taken and planned by the sponsors of the regional center; Include a detailed prediction [3] how the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy based on factors such as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and without the regional center; and Be supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools, including, but not limited to, feasibility studies, analyses of foreign and domestic markets for the goods or services to be exported, or multiplier tables. [4] The level of verifiable detail required for a Form I-924 to be approved and provided deference may vary depending on the nature of the application filing. [5] A. Regional Center Application Proposals The regional center proposal must include a management and operational plan to administer, oversee, and manage the proposed regional center, including but not limited to how the regional center: Will be promoted to attract immigrant investors, including a description of the budget for promotional activities; Will identify, assess, and evaluate proposed immigrant investor projects and enterprises; Characterizes the structure of the investment capital it will sponsor; for example, whether the investment capital to be sought for job-creating companies will consist solely of immigrant investor capital or a combination of immigrant investor capital and domestic capital, and how the distribution of the investment capital will be structured (for example, loans to developers or venture capital); and Will oversee all investment activities affiliated with, through, or under the sponsorship of the proposed regional center. Geographic Area An officer reviews the proposed geographic boundaries of a new regional center to determine if they are acceptable. USCIS considers geographic boundaries acceptable if the regional center applicant can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed area. [6] The determination is fact-specific, and the law does not require any particular form of evidence, such as a county-by-county analysis. In addition, a regional center’s geographic area must be limited, contiguous, and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. [7] To demonstrate that the proposed geographic area is limited, the regional center applicant should submit evidence demonstrating the linkages between proposed economic activities within the proposed area based on different variables. Examples of variables to demonstrate linkages between economic activities can include but are not limited to: Regional connectivity; The labor pool and supply chain; and Interdependence between projects. Moreover, in assessing the likelihood that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed geographic area, an officer reviews the impact of the activity relative to relevant", "metadata": {"id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6", "title": "Volume 6 - Immigrants | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff-2"}}

Moreover, in assessing the likelihood that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed geographic area, an officer reviews the impact of the activity relative to relevant economic conditions. The size of the proposed area should be limited and consistent with the scope and scale of the proposed economic activity, as the regional center applicant is required to focus on a geographical region of the United States. [8] The regional center applicant must present an economic analysis of its proposed economic activity in the proposed geographic area that is supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools. [9] The Form I-924 instructions provide further information regarding the requirements of the economic analysis. B. Types of Regional Center Projects An actual project refers to a specific project proposal that is supported by a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant business plan. [10] A hypothetical project refers to a project proposal that is not supported by a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant business plan. The term exemplar refers to a sample Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor (Form I-526), filed with Form I-924 for an actual project. This type of regional center proposal contains copies of the commercial enterprise’s organizational and transactional documents, which USCIS reviews to determine if they are in compliance with established eligibility requirements. 1. Hypothetical Projects If the Form I-924 projects are hypothetical projects, general proposals and general predictions may be sufficient to determine that the proposed regional center will more likely than not promote economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. A regional center applicant seeking review of a hypothetical project should clarify in the Form I-924 submission that the project is hypothetical. General proposals and predictions may include a description of the project parameters, such as: Proposed project activities, industries, locations, and timelines; A general market analysis of the proposed job creating activities and explanation regarding how the proposed project activities are likely to promote economic growth and create jobs; and A description, along with supporting evidence, of the regional center principals’ relevant experience and expertise. While hypothetical project submissions are sufficient for regional center designation, previous determinations based on hypothetical projects will not receive deference. Actual projects will receive a de novo officer review during subsequent filings (for example, through the adjudication of an amended Form I-924 application, including the actual project details or the first Form I-526 immigrant investor petition). Organizational and transactional supporting documents are not required for a hypothetical project. If a regional center applicant desires a compliance review of organizational and transactional documents, the application must include an actual project with a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant business plan and an exemplar immigrant investor petition. 2. Actual Projects Applications for regional center designation based on actual projects may require more details than a hypothetical project to demonstrate that the proposal contains verifiable details and is supported by economically or statistically sound forecasting tools. A regional center applicant seeking review of an actual project should clarify in the Form I-924 submission that the project is actual. Actual projects require a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant comprehensive business plan that provides verifiable detail on how jobs will be created. Absent fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legal deficiency, [11] USCIS defers to prior determinations based on actual projects when evaluating subsequent filings under the project involving the same material facts and issues. Organizational and transactional documents for the new commercial enterprise are not required. If a regional center applicant desires review of organizational and transactional documents for program compliance, the regional center application must be accompanied by an exemplar Form I-526 immigrant investor petition. If regional center applicants opt not to file a Form I-924 amendment, the investor should identify his or her Form I-526 immigrant investor petition as an actual project being presented for the first time. Additionally, the immigrant petition should contain an affirmative statement signed by a regional center principal confirming that the regional center is aware of the specific project being presented for the first time as part of the immigrant investor petition. In cases where the regional center application is filed based on actual projects that do not contain sufficient verifiable detail, USCIS may approve the projects as hypothetical projects if they contain", "metadata": {"id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6", "title": "Volume 6 - Immigrants | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff-3"}}
{"text": "compliance, the regional center application must be accompanied by an exemplar Form I-526 immigrant investor petition. If regional center applicants opt not to file a Form I-924 amendment, the investor should identify his or her Form I-526 immigrant investor petition as an actual project being presented for the first time. Additionally, the immigrant petition should contain an affirmative statement signed by a regional center principal confirming that the regional center is aware of the specific project being presented for the first time as part of the immigrant investor petition. In cases where the regional center application is filed based on actual projects that do not contain sufficient verifiable detail, USCIS may approve the projects as hypothetical projects if they contain the requisite general proposals and predictions. The projects approved as hypotheticals, however, do not receive deference in subsequent filings. In cases where some projects are approvable as actual projects, and others are not approvable or only approvable as hypothetical projects, the approval notice should identify which projects have been approved as actual projects and will be accorded deference. The approval notice should also identify projects that have been approved as hypothetical projects but will not be accorded deference. 3. Exemplar Filings Regional center applications, based on actual projects, including a Form I-526 immigrant investor exemplar petition, require more details than a hypothetical or actual project submitted without an exemplar. A regional center applicant seeking review of an exemplar should state that the project is an actual project with a Form I-526 exemplar. Exemplar filings require a Matter of Ho (PDF) compliant comprehensive business plan that provides verifiable detail on how jobs will be created, as well as organizational and transactional documents for the new commercial enterprise. Absent fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legal deficiency, officer determinations based on exemplar filings are accorded deference in subsequent filings under the project with the same material facts and issues. While an amended Form I-924 is not required to perfect a hypothetical project once the actual project details are available, some applicants may choose to file an amended Form I-924 application with a Form I-526 exemplar to obtain a favorable determination. These exemplar filings are accorded deference in subsequent related filings, absent material change, fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legally deficient determination. C. Regional Center Annual Reporting Designated regional centers must file a Supplement to Form I-924 (Form I-924A) annually that demonstrates continued eligibility for designation as a regional center in the EB-5 Program. [12] The regional center must file the form within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year (between October 1 and December 29). The Form I-924A instructions specifically list required information that must be submitted. [13] If the regional center fails to file the required annual report, USCIS issues a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) to the regional center for failing to provide the required information. This may ultimately result in the termination of the regional center’s designation if the regional center fails to respond or does not file a response which adequately demonstrates continued eligibility. D. Regional Center Amendments Because businesses’ strategies constantly evolve, with new opportunities identified and existing plans improved, a regional center may amend a previously approved designation. The Form I-924 instructions provide information regarding the submission of regional center amendment requests. [14] To improve processing efficiencies and predictability in subsequent filings, many regional centers may seek to amend the Form I-924 approval to reflect changes in economic analysis and job creation estimates. Such amendments, however, are not required in order for individual investors to proceed with filing the immigrant petitions or petitions to remove conditions on residence based on the additional jobs created, or to be created, in additional industries. Formal amendments to an approved regional center’s designation are not required when a regional center changes its industries of focus, business plans, or economic methodologies; however, a regional center may find it advantageous to seek USCIS approval of such changes before they are adjudicated in individual immigrant investor petitions. Requests to Change Geographic Area When a regional center requests to expand its geographic area, the proposed geographic area must be limited, contiguous, and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones. [15] Any requests for geographic area expansion made on or after February 22, 2017 are adjudicated under the current guidance in the Form I-924 instructions which requires that a Form I-924 amendment must be filed, and approved, to expand the regional center’s geographic area. The Form I-924 amendment must be approved before an I-526 petitioner may demonstrate eligibility at the time of filing his or her petition based on an investment in the expanded area. If the regional center’s geographic area expansion request was submitted either through a Form I-924 amendment or Form I-526 petition filed prior to", "metadata": {"id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6", "title": "Volume 6 - Immigrants | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "b6a5e7ce529e25ff-4"}}

The Form I-924 amendment must be approved before an I-526 petitioner may demonstrate eligibility at the time of filing his or her petition based on an investment in the expanded area. If the regional center’s geographic area expansion request was submitted either through a Form I-924 amendment or Form I-526 petition filed prior to February 22, 2017, and the request is ultimately approved, USCIS will continue to adjudicate additional Form I-526 petitions associated with investments in that area under prior policy guidance issued on May 30, 2013. [16] That policy did not require a formal amendment to expand a regional center’s geographic area, and permitted concurrent filing of the Form I-526 prior to approval of the geographic area amendment. E. Termination of a Regional Center Designation USCIS issues a NOIT if: USCIS determines that a regional center no longer serves the purpose of promoting economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment; or The regional center fails to submit required information to USCIS. [17] The NOIT will provide the grounds for termination and provide at least 30 days from receipt of the NOIT for the regional center to respond to the allegations in the NOIT. The regional center may offer evidence to contest the allegations in the NOIT. If the regional center overcomes the allegations in the NOIT, USCIS issues a Notice of Reaffirmation that affirms the regional center’s designation. If the regional center fails to overcome the allegations in the NOIT, USCIS terminates the regional center’s participation in the Regional Center Program. In this case, USCIS notifies the regional center of the termination, the reasons for termination, and the right to file a motion, appeal, or both. The regional center may appeal the decision to USCIS’ Administrative Appeals Office within 30 days after service of notice (33 days, if the notice was mailed).

[6] These updates and clarifications of current USCIS policy guidance are based on USCIS interpretation of the applicable terms in DHS regulations and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue an interpretive rule or one that amends or repeals an existing interpretive rule, [7] or when modifying rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. [8] However, the instruction to not require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification was a policy change in response to the resource strain of ongoing litigation. As with all other policy guidance USCIS issues, these updates and clarifications to officers do not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights, obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS will evaluate SIJ petitions. Accordingly, USCIS published no Federal Register notices requesting public comment because public notice is not required for these internal policy changes and clarifications.

{"text": "practice. [8] However, the instruction to not require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification was a policy change in response to the resource strain of ongoing litigation. As with all other policy guidance USCIS issues, these updates and clarifications to officers do not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights, obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS will evaluate SIJ petitions. Accordingly, USCIS published no Federal Register notices requesting public comment because public notice is not required for these internal policy changes and clarifications. Unfair Surprise and Reliance Interest An agency can change its interpretation of a regulation at different times in its history as long as the interpretative changes create no unfair surprise. [9] In this case, USCIS is not changing its policy regarding SIJ adjudications. USCIS is updating this guidance to clarify what the law and regulations permit or require because of potential confusion. It has never been USCIS official policy to grant SIJ classification based on a state judge’s order that is sought primarily to permit the alien to obtain lawful immigration status. USCIS has analyzed the potential for and taken into account serious reliance interests that may be engendered by the practices USCIS officers may have followed prior to this clarification. USCIS acknowledges that a person who may have been approved for SIJ classification before this policy alert may no longer be approved by an officer following this clarifying guidance in rendering their decision. An advocate or representative of an SIJ petitioner, not knowing of this policy, may erroneously petition the state court judge who is handling their client’s case to issue an order with findings of fact in support of the petitioner’s eligibility for SIJ that does not provide relief from parental abuse, neglect, abandonment or a similar basis under state law. However, the statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria have never permitted SIJ classification to be approved using such state court orders, nor has it been official USCIS policy. Therefore, an SIJ petitioner cannot be said to have acted in reliance on the continuation of a practice and policy that has not been a USCIS practice and policy and which is contrary to the law. USCIS must limit the approval of SIJ classification to cases who are eligible based on a valid court order as required by the INA regardless of its effects on parties who may rely on erroneous state court orders. With respect to the policy change to no longer require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification, USCIS made that change in response to the strain of litigation. USCIS anticipated that the change would not negatively impact petitioners with potential reliance interests, rather it would reduce their evidentiary burden. Implementation USCIS implemented this policy update immediately, as it was merely a clarification. However, USCIS still allowed interested parties an opportunity to comment by providing a 10-day comment period, as is generally provided for Policy Manual publications.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and implementing regulations provide for several employment-based immigrant visa classifications. Alien beneficiaries approved in these classifications are eligible to apply for lawful admission as a permanent resident or adjustment of status to permanent residence. B. Background In general, for an Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers ( Form I-140 ), a petitioner must demonstrate to USCIS that the beneficiary is qualified for the immigrant classification sought. [1] If the petition is based on an underlying approved permanent labor certification application, then the petition must be filed during the validity period of the permanent labor certification established by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The petitioner must demonstrate that the beneficiary is qualified for the position certified by DOL. However, as discussed in more detail later in this part, there are several immigrant classifications that do not require the petitioner to first obtain a permanent labor certification. In addition, in certain classifications, the beneficiary is able to self-petition for the classification sought. General information relating to employment-based immigrant petitions is provided in Part E. [2] This Part F provides a more detailed discussion of the specific immigrant classifications. Visa Classifications The following table lists the employment-based immigrant visa classifications, the corresponding codes of admission, and where to find additional guidance about the classifications.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability A. Eligibility When seeking classification as a person of extraordinary ability, a petitioner files an Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers ( Form I-140 ) on behalf of an alien (who may be the petitioner) with evidence demonstrating that the beneficiary is eligible. [1] Eligibility for Extraordinary Ability Classification The person has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim, and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation. The person seeks to enter the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability. The person's entry into the United States will substantially benefit the United States in the future. Self-Petitioners A petition filed on behalf of a person with extraordinary ability does not need to be supported by a job offer; therefore, anyone can file the petition on behalf of the person, including the alien who may file as a self-petitioner. [2] The person must still demonstrate, however, that he or she intends to continue work in the area of his or her extraordinary ability and that his or her work will substantially benefit the United States in the future. [3] 1. Sustained National or International Acclaim When filing a petition for a person with extraordinary ability, the petitioner must submit evidence that the person has sustained national or international acclaim and that the person's achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise. [4] In determining whether the beneficiary has enjoyed \"sustained\" national or international acclaim, the officer should consider that such acclaim must be maintained. [5] However, the term sustained does not imply an age limit on the beneficiary. A beneficiary may be very young or early in his or her career and still be able to show sustained acclaim. There is also no definitive time frame on what constitutes sustained. If a person was recognized for a particular achievement, the officer should determine whether the person continues to maintain a comparable level of acclaim in the field of expertise since the person was originally afforded that recognition. A person may, for example, have achieved national or international acclaim in the past but then failed to maintain a comparable level of acclaim thereafter. 2. Continuing to Work in the Area of Expertise To qualify as a person with extraordinary ability, the beneficiary must intend to continue to work in the area of his or her expertise. [6] The officer may encounter instances where it is difficult to determine whether the person’s intended employment falls sufficiently within the bounds of his or her area of extraordinary ability. Some of the most problematic cases are those in which the beneficiary’s sustained national or international acclaim is based on his or her abilities as an athlete, but the beneficiary’s intent is to come to the United States and be employed as an athletic coach or manager. Competitive athletics and coaching rely on different sets of skills and in general are not in the same area of expertise. However, many extraordinary athletes have gone on to be extraordinary coaches. Therefore, in general, if a beneficiary has clearly achieved recent national or international acclaim as an athlete and has sustained that acclaim in the field of coaching or managing at a national level, officers can consider the totality of the evidence as establishing an overall pattern of sustained acclaim and extraordinary ability such that USCIS can conclude that coaching is within the beneficiary’s area of expertise. Where the beneficiary has had an extended period of time to establish his or her reputation as a coach beyond the years in which he or she had sustained national or international acclaim as an athlete, depending on the specific facts, officers may place heavier, or exclusive, weight on the evidence of the beneficiary’s achievements as a coach or a manager. USCIS does not consider a male athlete who has gained the necessary acclaim in men’s sports and seeks to compete in women’s sports in the United States to be seeking to continue work in his area of extraordinary ability. [7] 3. Entry to Substantially Benefit the United States To qualify as a person with extraordinary ability, the person’s entry must substantially benefit the United States in the future. [8] Although neither the statute nor the regulations specifically define the statutory phrase “substantially benefit,” it has been interpreted broadly. [9] Whether the petitioner demonstrates that the person’s employment meets this requirement requires a fact-dependent assessment of the case. In some cases, a Request for Evidence (RFE) may be appropriate if an officer is not yet satisfied that the petitioner has met this requirement. There is no standard rule as to what will substantially benefit the United States. However, male athletes seeking to enter the United", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-0"}}

There is no standard rule as to what will substantially benefit the United States. However, male athletes seeking to enter the United States to compete in women’s sports do not substantially benefit prospectively the United States. [10] B. Evidence of Extraordinary Ability The regulations describe various types of evidence that the petitioner must submit in support of a petition as documentation of the beneficiary’s extraordinary ability. [11] In general, the petitioner must submit evidence that: The person has sustained national or international acclaim; and The person’s achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise. This initial evidence must include either evidence of a one-time achievement (for example, a major internationally recognized award, such as the Nobel Prize) or at least three of the types of evidence listed in the regulations. [12] The evidence provided in support of the petition need not specifically use the words \"extraordinary.\" Rather, the material should be such that it is readily apparent that the person's contributions to the field are qualifying. Also, although some of the regulatory language relating to evidence occasionally uses plurals, it is entirely possible that the presentation of a single piece of evidence in a specific evidentiary category may be sufficient. On the other hand, the submission of voluminous documentation may not contain sufficient persuasive evidence to establish the beneficiary’s eligibility. The evidence provided in support of the petition must ultimately establish that the beneficiary \"is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.\" [13] Officers should use a two-step analysis to evaluate the evidence submitted with the petition to demonstrate eligibility for classification as a person with extraordinary ability. [14] Petition for Extraordinary Ability Classification: Overview of Two-Step Evidentiary Review Step 1 Assess whether evidence meets regulatory criteria: Determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, which evidence submitted by the petitioner objectively meets the parameters of the regulatory description that applies to that type of evidence (referred to as \"regulatory criteria\"). Step 2 Final merits determination: Evaluate all the evidence together when considering the petition in its entirety for the final merits determination, in the context of the high level of expertise required for this immigrant classification. 1. Initial Evidence of Extraordinary Ability The first step of the evidentiary review is limited to determining whether the evidence submitted with the petition meets the regulatory criteria. [15] The evidence must be comprised of either a one-time achievement (that is, a major, internationally recognized award) or at least three of the ten regulatory criteria or be comparable to at least three of the ten regulatory criteria. [16] The officer should apply a preponderance of the evidence standard when making this determination. For purposes of the first step of the analysis, officers should consider the quality and caliber of the evidence to determine whether a particular regulatory criterion has been met, to the extent the criterion has qualitative requirements. [17] Officers should not yet make a determination regarding whether or not the person is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field or if the person has sustained national or international acclaim. [18] The following tables describe the limited determinations the officer should make in the first step of the analysis to determine whether the person has met the applicable evidentiary criteria, including any qualifying comparable evidence. [19] Criterion 1: Receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. [20] First, USCIS determines if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. Nothing precludes the person from relying on a team award, provided the person is one of the recipients of the award. [21] The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes. Second, USCIS determines whether the award is a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prize or award which the person received for excellence in the field of endeavor. As indicated by the plain language of the regulation, this criterion does not require an award or prize to have the same", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-1"}}

[21] The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes. Second, USCIS determines whether the award is a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prize or award which the person received for excellence in the field of endeavor. As indicated by the plain language of the regulation, this criterion does not require an award or prize to have the same level of recognition and prestige associated with the Nobel Prize or another award that would qualify as a one-time achievement. Examples of qualifying awards may include, but are not limited to: Certain awards from well-known national institutions or well-known professional associations; Certain doctoral dissertation awards; and Certain awards recognizing presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences. Considerations: Relevant considerations regarding whether the basis for granting the prizes or awards was excellence in the field include, but are not limited to: The criteria used to grant the awards or prizes; The national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field; The number of awardees or prize recipients; and Limitations on competitors. While many scholastic awards do not have the requisite level of recognition, there may be some that are nationally or internationally recognized as awards for excellence such that they may satisfy the requirements of this criterion. For example, an award available only to persons within a single locality, employer, or school may have little national or international recognition, while an award open to members of a well-known national institution (including an R1 or R2 doctoral university [22] ) or professional organization may be nationally recognized. Similarly, national or international recognition is most often associated with awards given to individuals at the highest level in a given field. However, there is no specific requirement that an award be open to all members of the field, including the most experienced, in order to meet the requirements of this criterion. While limitations on competitors can be a relevant factor, in some instances the evidence may establish that an award or prize is nationally or internationally recognized despite being limited to youth, amateur competitors, or early-career professionals. For instance, awards presented to new players or “rookies” in major sports leagues may garner national or even international media coverage. Criterion 2: Membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought that require outstanding achievement of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields. [23] USCIS determines if the association for which the person claims present or past membership [24] requires that members have outstanding achievements in the field as judged by recognized experts in that field. Examples of associations in the field requiring outstanding achievement of their members may include, but are not limited to: A membership in certain professional associations; and A fellowship with certain organizations or institutions. Considerations: The petitioner must show that membership in the association requires outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought, as judged by recognized national or international experts. Associations may have multiple levels of membership. The level of membership afforded to the person must show that in order to obtain that level of membership, recognized national or international experts judged the person as having attained outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought. As a possible example, general membership in an international organization for engineering and technology professionals may not meet the requirements of the criterion. However, if that same organization at the fellow level requires, in part, that a nominee have accomplishments that have, for example, contributed importantly to the advancement or application of engineering, science, and technology, and that a council of experts and a committee of current fellows judges the nominations for fellows, that higher, fellow level may be qualifying. Another possible qualifying example may include membership as a fellow in a scientific society dedicated to artificial intelligence if the membership is based on recognition of a nominee’s significant, sustained contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, and a panel of current fellows makes the selection of new fellows. Relevant factors that may lead to a conclusion that the person's membership in the association(s) was not based on outstanding achievements in the field include, but are not limited to, instances where the person's membership was based solely on the following factors (by themselves or in the aggregate): A level of education or years of experience in a particular field; The payment of a fee or by subscribing to", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-2"}}

Another possible qualifying example may include membership as a fellow in a scientific society dedicated to artificial intelligence if the membership is based on recognition of a nominee’s significant, sustained contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, and a panel of current fellows makes the selection of new fellows. Relevant factors that may lead to a conclusion that the person's membership in the association(s) was not based on outstanding achievements in the field include, but are not limited to, instances where the person's membership was based solely on the following factors (by themselves or in the aggregate): A level of education or years of experience in a particular field; The payment of a fee or by subscribing to an association's publications; and A requirement, compulsory or otherwise, for employment in certain occupations, as commonly seen with union membership or guild affiliation for actors. Criterion 3: Published material about the person in professional or major trade publications or other major media relating to the person's work in the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence must include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation. [25] First, USCIS determines whether the published material was related to the person and the person's specific work in the field for which classification is sought. Examples of qualifying media may include, but are not limited to: Professional or major print publications (newspaper articles, popular and academic journal articles, books, textbooks, or similar publications) regarding the person and the person’s work; Professional or major online publications regarding the person and the person’s work; and Transcripts of professional or major audio or video coverage of the person and the person’s work. Considerations: The published material should be about the person, relating to the person’s work in the field, and not just about the person’s employer and the employer’s work or about another organization and that organization’s work. Marketing materials created for the purpose of selling the person's products or promoting the person’s services are not generally considered to be published material about the person (this includes seemingly objective content about the person in major print publications that the person or the person’s employer paid for). However, the person and the person’s work need not be the only subject of the material; published material that covers a broader topic but includes a substantial discussion of the person’s work in the field and mentions the person in connection to the work may be considered material about the person relating to the person’s work. Moreover, officers may consider material that focuses solely or primarily on work or research being undertaken by a team of which the person is a member, provided that the material mentions the person in connection with the work or other evidence in the record documents the person’s significant role in the work or research. Evidence may include documentation such as print or online newspaper or magazine articles, popular or academic journal articles, books, textbooks, similar publications, or a transcript of professional or major audio or video coverage of the person and the person’s work. Second, USCIS determines whether the publication qualifies as a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media publication. In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional and major trade publications) and the relative circulation, readership, or viewership (for major trade publications and other major media). Criterion 4: The person's participation, either individually or on a panel, as a judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specification for which classification is sought. [26] USCIS determines whether the person has acted as the judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specification. Examples of judging the work of others may include, but are not limited to: Peer reviewing for a scholarly journal, as evidenced by a request from the journal to the person to do the review, accompanied by proof that the review was actually completed; Peer review of abstracts or papers submitted for presentation at scholarly conferences in the respective field; Serving as a member of a Ph.D. dissertation committee that makes the final judgment as to whether a candidate’s body of work satisfies the requirements for a doctoral degree, as evidenced by departmental records; and Peer reviewer for government research funding programs. Considerations: The petitioner must show that the person has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the person actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization. For example, a petitioner might document the person’s peer review work by submitting a copy of a request from a journal to", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-3"}}

Considerations: The petitioner must show that the person has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the person actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied field of specialization. For example, a petitioner might document the person’s peer review work by submitting a copy of a request from a journal to the person to do the review, accompanied by evidence confirming that the person actually completed the review. Criterion 5: The person's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field. [27] First, USCIS determines whether the person has made original contributions in the field. Second, USCIS determines whether the original contributions are of major significance to the field. Examples of relevant evidence include, but are not limited to: Published materials about the significance of the person’s original work; Testimonials, letters, and affidavits about the person’s original work; Documentation that the person’s original work was cited at a level indicative of major significance in the field; and Patents or licenses deriving from the person’s work or evidence of commercial use of the person’s work. Considerations: Analysis under this criterion focuses on whether the person’s original work constitutes major, significant contributions to the field. Evidence that the person’s work was funded, patented, or published, while potentially demonstrating the work’s originality, will not necessarily establish, on its own, that the work is of major significance to the field. For example, published research that has provoked widespread commentary on its importance from others working in the field, and documentation that it has been highly cited relative to others’ work in that field, may be probative of the significance of the person’s contributions to the field of endeavor. Similarly, evidence that the person developed a patented technology that has attracted significant attention or commercialization may establish the significance of the person’s original contribution to the field. If a patent remains pending, USCIS generally requires additional supporting evidence to document the originality of the person’s contribution, such as detailed reference letters. Detailed letters from experts in the field explaining the nature and significance of the person’s contribution may also provide valuable context for evaluating the claimed original contributions of major significance, particularly when the record includes documentation corroborating the claimed significance. Submitted letters should specifically describe the person’s contribution and its significance to the field and should also set forth the basis of the writer’s knowledge and expertise. Criterion 6: The person's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other major media. [28] First, USCIS determines whether the person has authored scholarly articles in the field. As defined in the academic arena, a scholarly article reports on original research, experimentation, or philosophical discourse. It is written by a researcher or expert in the field who is often affiliated with a college, university, or research institution. Scholarly articles are also generally peer reviewed by other experts in the field of specialization. In general, it should have footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography, and may include graphs, charts, videos, or pictures as illustrations of the concepts expressed in the article. Examples of scholarly article authorship include, but are not limited to: Publications in professionally-relevant peer-reviewed journals; and Published conference presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences. [29] For other fields, a scholarly article should be written for learned persons in that field. (\"Learned\" is defined as \"having profound knowledge gained by study\"). [30] Learned persons include all persons having profound knowledge of a field. Second, USCIS determines whether the publication qualifies as a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media publication. In evaluating whether a submitted publication is a professional publication or major media, relevant factors include the intended audience (for professional journals) and the circulation or readership relative to other media in the field (for major media). Criterion 7: Display of the person's work in the field at artistic exhibitions or showcases. [31] First, USCIS determines whether the work that was displayed is the person's work product. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation provides that the work must be the person's work product. Second, USCIS determines whether the venues (virtual or otherwise) where the person's work was displayed were artistic exhibitions or showcases. Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines “exhibition” as a public showing (as of works of art, objects of manufacture, or athletic skill). [32] While the dictionary definition includes public showings", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-4"}}

The description of this type of evidence in the regulation provides that the work must be the person's work product. Second, USCIS determines whether the venues (virtual or otherwise) where the person's work was displayed were artistic exhibitions or showcases. Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines “exhibition” as a public showing (as of works of art, objects of manufacture, or athletic skill). [32] While the dictionary definition includes public showings other than those that are artistic in nature, the plain language of the criterion includes the modifier “artistic” and explicitly requires that the exhibitions or showcases be artistic in nature. USCIS only considers non-artistic exhibitions or showcases as part of a properly supported claim of comparable evidence, discussed in more detail below. Criterion 8: The person has performed in a leading or critical role for organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation. [33] First, USCIS determines whether the person has performed in a leading or critical role for an organization, establishment, or a division or department of an organization or establishment. Examples of lead or critical roles may include, but are not limited to: Senior faculty or senior research position for a distinguished academic department or program; Senior research position for a distinguished non-academic institution or company; Principal or named investigator for a department, institution, or business that received a merit-based government award, such as an academic research or Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant; [34] Member of a key committee within a distinguished organization; Founder or co-founder of, or contributor of intellectual property to, a startup business that has a distinguished reputation; and Leading or critical role for a distinguished organization or a distinguished division of an institution or company, as explained in detail by the director or a principal investigator of the relevant organization or division. Considerations: In evaluating such evidence, officers examine whether the role is (or was) leading or critical. For a leading role, officers look at whether the evidence establishes that the person is (or was) a leader within the organization or establishment or a division or department thereof. A title, with appropriate matching duties, can help to establish that a role is (or was), in fact, leading. For a critical role, officers look at whether the evidence establishes that the person has contributed in a way that is of significant importance to the outcome of the organization or establishment's activities or those of a division or department of the organization or establishment. A supporting role may be considered critical if the person's performance in the role is (or was) important. It is not the title of the person's role, but rather the person's performance in the role that determines whether the role is (or was) critical. This is one criterion where letters from persons with personal knowledge of the significance of the person's leading or critical role can be particularly helpful to officers in making this determination, so long as the letters contain detailed and probative information that specifically addresses how the person's role for the organization, establishment, division, or department was leading or critical. Evidence of experience must consist of letters from employers. [35] Second, USCIS determines whether the organization or establishment, or the department or division for which the person holds or held a leading or critical role, has a distinguished reputation. The relative size or longevity of an organization or establishment is not in and of itself a determining factor but is considered together with other information to determine whether a distinguished reputation exists. Other relevant factors for evaluating the reputation of an organization or establishment can include the scale of its customer base or relevant media coverage. For academic departments, programs, and institutions, officers may also consider relevant and credible national rankings and receipt of government research grants as positive factors. For a startup business, officers may consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders commensurate with funding rounds generally achieved for that startup’s stage and industry, as a positive factor regarding its distinguished reputation. Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines “distinguished” as “marked by eminence, distinction, or excellence” or “befitting an eminent person.” [36] Criterion 9: The person has commanded a high salary, or other significantly high remuneration for services, in relation to others in the field. [37] USCIS determines whether the person's salary or remuneration is high relative to the compensation paid to others working in the field. USCIS does not interpret the phrase “has commanded”", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-5"}}

For a startup business, officers may consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders commensurate with funding rounds generally achieved for that startup’s stage and industry, as a positive factor regarding its distinguished reputation. Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines “distinguished” as “marked by eminence, distinction, or excellence” or “befitting an eminent person.” [36] Criterion 9: The person has commanded a high salary, or other significantly high remuneration for services, in relation to others in the field. [37] USCIS determines whether the person's salary or remuneration is high relative to the compensation paid to others working in the field. USCIS does not interpret the phrase “has commanded” to mean that the person must have already earned such salary or remuneration in order to meet the criterion. Rather, a credible contract or job offer showing prospective salary or remuneration may establish that the person has been able to command such compensation. Evidence relevant to demonstrating high remuneration may include, but is not limited to: Tax returns, pay statements, or other evidence of past salary or remuneration for services; Contract, job offer letter, or other evidence of prospective salary or remuneration for services; and Comparative wage or remuneration data for the person’s field, such as geographical or position-appropriate compensation surveys. Considerations: Evidence regarding whether the person's compensation is high relative to that of others working in the field may take many forms. Examples may include, but are not limited to, geographical or position-appropriate compensation surveys and organizational justifications to pay above the compensation data. The following websites, among others, may be helpful in evaluating the relative compensation for a given field: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Overview of BLS Wage Data by Area and Occupation webpage; and The Department of Labor's Career One Stop website. When evaluating whether a comparison between the beneficiary’s documented remuneration and the remuneration in the survey is accurate, the following considerations, among others, may be relevant: The description of the occupation. Broad descriptions that include multiple occupations or multiple industries may not provide an accurate comparison to others in the field. For example, “directors and producers” might be listed as a single category across industries, but evidence that a film director receives high remuneration based on a broad range of occupational data that include disparate occupations such as film director and radio show producer, may not be sufficiently probative; The validity of the survey. Some websites provide user-reported salary data, which may not be a valid comparison if, for example, too few users reported their salaries or the data is otherwise not credible or reliable; Location and currency. Officers evaluate persons working outside of the United States based on the wage statistics or comparable evidence relevant to the applicable work location, rather than by simply converting the salary to U.S. dollars and then viewing whether that salary would be considered high in the United States; and Salary rate being measured. Officers consider whether the comparison data measures an hourly rate or an annual salary. Another consideration is how that information compares to the beneficiary’s pay. Many artists are not paid an hourly rate but instead are paid a daily rate (which may not be equivalent to 8 hours) or are paid a certain amount for a project (involving an unknown number of hours). However, hourly wage data may still be probative if the petitioner submits documentation regarding the number of hours worked. Such documentation can include, but is not limited to, pay statements, personnel records, or testimonial evidence from the relevant employer. For entrepreneurs or founders of startup businesses, officers consider evidence that the business has received significant funding from government entities, venture capital funds, angel investors, or other such funders in evaluating the credibility of submitted contracts, job offer letters, or other evidence of prospective salary or remuneration for services. Criterion 10: Commercial successes in the performing arts, as shown by box office receipts or record, cassette, compact disk, or video sales. [38] USCIS determines whether the person has enjoyed commercial successes in the performing arts. This criterion focuses on volume of sales and box office receipts as a measure of the person's commercial success in the performing arts. Therefore, the mere fact that a person has recorded and released musical compilations or performed in theatrical, motion picture, or television productions would be insufficient, in and of itself, to meet this criterion. The evidence must show that the volume of sales and box office receipts reflect the person's commercial success relative to others involved in similar pursuits in the performing arts. Comparable evidence: Comparable evidence to establish the person's eligibility if the standards do not readily apply to the person's occupation. [39] USCIS determines if the evidence submitted is comparable to the", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-6"}}

The evidence must show that the volume of sales and box office receipts reflect the person's commercial success relative to others involved in similar pursuits in the performing arts. Comparable evidence: Comparable evidence to establish the person's eligibility if the standards do not readily apply to the person's occupation. [39] USCIS determines if the evidence submitted is comparable to the evidence required in 8 CFR 204.5(h)(3) This regulatory provision provides petitioners the opportunity to submit comparable evidence to establish the person's eligibility, if it is determined that the evidentiary criteria described in the regulations do not readily apply to the person's occupation. When evaluating such comparable evidence, officers must consider whether the regulatory criteria are readily applicable to the person's occupation and, if not, whether the evidence provided is truly comparable to the criteria listed in that regulation. A general unsupported assertion that the listed evidentiary criterion does not readily apply to the petitioner’s occupation is not probative. Similarly, general claims that USCIS should accept witness letters as comparable evidence are not persuasive. However, a statement from the petitioner can be sufficient to establish whether a criterion is readily applicable if that statement is detailed, specific, and credible. Although officers do not consider comparable evidence where a particular criterion is readily applicable to the person’s occupation, a criterion need not be entirely inapplicable to the person’s occupation. Rather, the officer considers comparable evidence if the petitioner shows that a criterion is not easily applicable to the person’s job or profession. [40] As with all extraordinary ability petitions, officers may consider comparable evidence in support of petitions for persons working in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields. Specifically, if a petitioner demonstrates that a particular criterion does not readily apply to the person’s occupation, the petitioner may submit evidence that is of comparable significance to that criterion to establish sustained acclaim and recognition. For instance, if the publication of scholarly articles is not readily applicable to a person whose occupation is in an industry rather than academia, a petitioner might demonstrate that the person’s presentation of work at a major trade show is of comparable significance to that criterion. As another example, if the petitioner demonstrates that receipt of a high salary is not readily applicable to the person’s position as an entrepreneur, the petitioner might present evidence that the person’s highly valued equity holdings in the startup are of comparable significance to the high salary criterion. The following are other non-exhaustive examples of where the comparable evidence provision might apply: A person who is an Olympic coach whose athlete wins an Olympic medal while under the person's principal tutelage would likely constitute evidence comparable to that in 8 CFR 204.5(h)(3)(v) ; or Election to a national all-star or Olympic team might serve as comparable evidence for evidence of memberships in 8 CFR 204.5(h)(3)(ii) There is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, international recognized award. Notably, the evidence evaluated in this step is also reviewed in the next step where the officer must determine whether the person is one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor, and that the person has sustained national or international acclaim. However, objectively meeting the regulatory criteria in the first step alone does not establish that the person in fact meets the requirements for classification as a person with extraordinary ability. [41] For example: Participating in the judging of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specialization alone, regardless of the circumstances, should satisfy the regulatory criteria in the first step of the analysis. However, the second step requires the officer to evaluate the person's participation to determine whether it was indicative of the person being one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor and enjoying sustained national or international acclaim. Publishing scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media alone, regardless of the caliber, should satisfy the regulatory criteria in the first step of the analysis. However, the second step requires the officer to evaluate the person's publications to determine whether they were indicative of the person being one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor and enjoying sustained national or international acclaim.

However, the second step requires the officer to evaluate the person's publications to determine whether they were indicative of the person being one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor and enjoying sustained national or international acclaim. The question of whether the person is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor and enjoys sustained national or international acclaim should be addressed in the second step of the analysis (final merits determination). In the first step, the officer is only required to determine if the evidence objectively meets the regulatory criteria. 2. Final Merits Determination In the second step of the analysis, the officer should consider the petition in its entirety to determine eligibility according to the standard. To establish eligibility, the petition must demonstrate that the person has sustained national or international acclaim and that their achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise, indicating that the person is one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor. The officer applies a preponderance of the evidence standard when making this determination. An officer may not limit the kind of evidence the officer thinks the person should be able to submit and deny the petition if that particular type of evidence (whether one of the prescribed types [42] or comparable evidence [43] ) is absent, if the person nonetheless submitted other types of evidence that meet the regulatory requirements for the classification. For example, an officer may think that if a person is extraordinary, there should be published articles about the person and the person’s work. However, an officer cannot deny the petition because no published articles were submitted, so long as the petitioner has submitted other evidence that meets the three qualifying criteria which demonstrates the person is in fact extraordinary. Approval or denial of a petition is based on the type and quality of evidence submitted rather than assumptions about the failure to address different criteria. At this step, officers consider any potentially relevant evidence in the record, even if such evidence does not fit one of the above regulatory criteria or was not presented as comparable evidence. The officers consider all evidence in the totality. Some evidence may weigh more favorably on its own, while other evidence is more persuasive when viewed with other evidence. The following are examples of situations where evidence in the record may help officers evaluate the quality of the initial or comparable evidence and determine whether in a totality analysis that considers all of the evidence, the person is among the small percentage at the top of the field and has sustained national or international acclaim: [44] The record demonstrates that the person has published articles in particularly highly-ranked journals (including published conference proceedings) relative to other journals in the field, as demonstrated by, for example, evidence the petitioner provides regarding the journal’s impact factor. [45] Depending on the level of recognition of the journals in question, as demonstrated by evidence in the record, there may be particular prestige or acclaim associated with publication in such journals, especially if the person is the most significant contributor to the published article, a senior author, or the sole author of the article; The petitioner provides evidence demonstrating that the total rate of citations to the person’s body of published work is high relative to others in the field, such as the person has a high h-index [46] for the field. Depending on the field and the comparative data the petitioner provides, such evidence may indicate a person’s high overall standing for the purpose of demonstrating that the person is among the small percentage at the top of the field; [47] The petitioner documents the person’s employment or research experience with leading institutions in the field (such as U.S. universities that have been recognized as having high or very high research activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, [48] foreign universities with comparably high research activity, or a university that is highly regarded according to a widely recognized metric such as the QS World University Rankings [49] ). Such employment or experience can be a positive factor toward demonstrating that the person is among the small percentage at the top of the field; The record establishes that the person has received unsolicited", "metadata": {"id": "227b441ad4a7965b", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Extraordinary Ability | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "227b441ad4a7965b-8"}}
{"text": "demonstrating that the person is among the small percentage at the top of the field; [47] The petitioner documents the person’s employment or research experience with leading institutions in the field (such as U.S. universities that have been recognized as having high or very high research activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, [48] foreign universities with comparably high research activity, or a university that is highly regarded according to a widely recognized metric such as the QS World University Rankings [49] ). Such employment or experience can be a positive factor toward demonstrating that the person is among the small percentage at the top of the field; The record establishes that the person has received unsolicited invitations to speak or present research at nationally or internationally recognized conferences in the field. This type of invitation is generally indicative of a person’s high standing and recognition for achievements in the field; and The record establishes that the person is named as an investigator, scientist, or researcher on a peer-reviewed and competitively-funded U.S. government grant or stipend for STEM research. This type of evidence can be a positive factor indicating a person is among the small percentage at the top of the person’s field. In all cases, the petitioner must provide sufficient context regarding the above evidence and considerations to demonstrate that the evidence meets the relevant criteria and to establish the person’s extraordinary ability in the totality of the circumstances. This means that the petitioner must explain the significance of the submitted evidence, and how it demonstrates that the person has achieved sustained national or international acclaim and recognition in their field of expertise. While a person may be stronger in one particular evidentiary area than in others, the totality of the evidence must establish that the person is extraordinary. If the officer determines that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate eligibility, the officer should not merely make general assertions regarding this failure. Rather, the officer must articulate the specific reasons as to why the officer concluded that the petitioner has not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has extraordinary ability. [50] As with all adjudications, if an officer believes that the facts stated in the petition are not true, and can articulate why in the denial, then the officer denies the petition and explains the reasons in the written denial. If requesting additional evidence is appropriate, officers should provide some explanation of the deficiencies in the evidence already submitted and, if possible, examples of persuasive evidence that the petitioner might provide to corroborate the statements made in the petition. If a petitioner has submitted evidence that the petitioner believes establishes the person's extraordinary ability, merely restating the evidentiary requirements or stating that the evidence submitted is insufficient does not clarify to the petitioner how to overcome the deficiencies. With respect to demonstrating extraordinary ability in athletics, USCIS considers a male athlete who has been competing against women to be a negative factor in determining whether the alien is among the small percentage at the very top of the field. [51] 3. Other Evidentiary Considerations Letters of Support Many petitions to classify a person with extraordinary ability contain letters of support. Letters of support, while not without weight, should not form the cornerstone of a successful claim for this classification. Rather, the statements made by the witnesses should be corroborated by documentary evidence in the record. The letters should explain in specific terms why the witnesses believe the beneficiary to be of the caliber of a person with extraordinary ability. Letters that merely reiterate USCIS’ definitions relating to this classification or make general and expansive statements regarding the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s accomplishments are generally not persuasive. The relationship or affiliation between the beneficiary and the witness is also a factor the officer should consider when evaluating the significance of witnesses’ statements. It is generally expected that one whose accomplishments have garnered sustained national or international acclaim would have received recognition for their accomplishments well beyond the circle of their personal and professional acquaintances. In some cases, letters from others in the beneficiary’s field may merely make general assertions about the beneficiary, and at most, indicate that the beneficiary is a competent, respected figure within the field of endeavor, but the record lacks sufficient, concrete evidence supporting such statements.

In some cases, letters from others in the beneficiary’s field may merely make general assertions about the beneficiary, and at most, indicate that the beneficiary is a competent, respected figure within the field of endeavor, but the record lacks sufficient, concrete evidence supporting such statements. These letters should be considered, but do not necessarily show the beneficiary’s claimed extraordinary ability. Evaluating Immigrant Petitions Filed on Behalf of O-1 Nonimmigrants An officer might encounter a case where a petition is filed on behalf of a person who was previously classified as an O-1 nonimmigrant with extraordinary ability, or extraordinary achievement in the case of persons in the motion picture and television industry. [52] Though the prior approval of an O-1 petition is a relevant consideration and can be an indicator of eligibility in adjudicating an immigrant petition for a person with extraordinary ability, it is not determinative. [53] Due to the similarities in many of the evidentiary requirements, some courts have asked USCIS to provide an explanation as to why, if the person had previously been classified in a roughly analogous nonimmigrant category, USCIS has determined that the person is not eligible for the employment-based immigrant visa classification in question. For this reason, where possible, officers issuing denials in such cases should provide a brief discussion as to why, notwithstanding the previous O-1 nonimmigrant visa petition approval, the petitioner has failed to meet its burden to establish that the beneficiary is eligible for classification as an immigrant with extraordinary ability.

See Garfield, E, The History and Meaning of the Journal Impact Factor , Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 295, Iss. 1, p. 90 (2006). [^ 46] The h-index is an example of a tool for measuring a researcher’s output and impact. It is based on the highest number of the researcher’s publications that have been cited at least that same number of times. For example, if a researcher has an h-index of 10, it means the researcher has 10 publications that have 10 or more citations each (but not 11 publications with at least 11 citations each). See Hirsch, J, An Index to Quantify an Individual’s Scientific Research Output , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 102, Iss. 46, p. 16569 (2005). Other indices for measuring output and impact are also used. When relying on any of these tools, a petitioner should explain its methodology and significance with supporting documentation because the sources for the data and the duration of time involved in the calculation can impact the actual h-index value.

Moreover, the O-1 nonimmigrant classification has different standards and criteria for persons in the arts and the motion picture and television industry when compared to the definition and standard set forth for immigrants with extraordinary ability. For example, a person in the arts may have extraordinary ability under the O-1 category because the person has distinction, which is defined as a nonimmigrant with extraordinary ability in the arts; but does not meet the definition for extraordinary ability according to the immigrant classification criteria, which is defined as a person who is among the small percentage at the very top of the field.

{"text": "Chapter 3 - Outstanding Professor or Researcher A. Eligibility A U.S. employer, including a university institution of higher learning or private employer, may petition for a professor or researcher who is internationally recognized as outstanding in a specific academic area to work in a tenured or tenure-track position or a comparable position to conduct research. [1] B. Evidence The regulation describes the evidence that the petitioner must submit in support of an Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers ( Form I-140 ) for an outstanding professor or researcher. [2] The petitioner must submit evidence to demonstrate that the beneficiary professor or researcher (beneficiary) is recognized internationally as outstanding in the academic field specified in the petition. Academic field means \"a body of specialized knowledge offered for study at an accredited U.S. university or institution of higher education.\" [3] By regulatory definition, a body of specialized knowledge is larger than a very small area of specialization in which only a single course is taught or that is the subject of a very specialized dissertation. As such, it would be acceptable to find the beneficiary is an outstanding professor or researcher in particle physics rather than physics in general, as long as the petitioner has demonstrated that the claimed field is \"a body of specialized knowledge offered for study at an accredited United States university or institution of higher education.\" [4] In addition, the petitioner must submit evidence of an offer from a qualifying prospective employer of tenured or tenure-track employment (for professors) or permanent employment (which can also include tenured or tenure track positions) in the case of research positions. [5] Finally, the petitioner must provide evidence that the beneficiary has had at least 3 years of experience in teaching or research in the academic field in which the beneficiary will be engaged. [6] Officers should use a two-step analysis to evaluate the evidence submitted with the petition to demonstrate eligibility for classification as an outstanding professor or researcher. [7] Petition to Classify an Outstanding Professor or Researcher: Overview of Two-Step Evidentiary Review Step 1 Assess whether evidence meets regulatory criteria: Determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, which evidence submitted by the petitioner objectively meets the parameters of the regulatory description that applies to that type of evidence (referred to as \"regulatory criteria\"). Step 2 Final merits determination: Evaluate all the evidence together when considering the petition in its entirety for the final merits determination, in the context of the high level of expertise required for this immigrant classification. Officers should apply a preponderance of the evidence standard when making these determinations. 1. Assess Whether Evidence Meets Any Regulatory Criteria The first step of the evidentiary review is limited to determining whether the evidence submitted with the petition is comprised of at least two of the six regulatory criteria. [8] For purposes of the first step of the analysis, officers should consider the quality and caliber of the evidence to determine whether a particular regulatory criterion has been met, to the extent the criterion has qualitative requirements. [9] Officers should not yet make a determination regarding whether or not the beneficiary is recognized internationally as outstanding in the academic field. For example: Participating in the judging of the work of others in the same or an allied academic field alone, regardless of the circumstances, should satisfy the regulatory criteria in step one. However, for the analysis in step two, the beneficiary's participation should be evaluated to determine whether it was indicative of the beneficiary being recognized internationally as outstanding in a specific academic area. Authorship of scholarly books or articles (in scholarly journals with international circulation) in the academic field alone, regardless of the caliber, should satisfy the regulatory criteria in step one. However, for the analysis in step two, the beneficiary's authorship of books or articles should be evaluated to determine whether they were indicative of the beneficiary being recognized internationally as outstanding in a specific academic area. The issue of whether the beneficiary is recognized internationally as outstanding in a specific academic area should be addressed in the second step of the analysis (final merits determination), not in the first step where the officer is only required to determine if the evidence objectively meets the regulatory criteria. The following tables provide details on the limited determinations that officers should make when first evaluating the evidence, including comparable evidence. Criterion 1: Receipt of major prizes or awards for outstanding achievement in the academic field. [10] First, USCIS determines if the beneficiary was the recipient of prizes or awards. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus must be on the beneficiary's receipt of the major prizes or awards, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the prizes or awards. Second, USCIS determines whether the", "metadata": {"id": "270bbc560bc0872e", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-3", "title": "Chapter 3 - Outstanding Professor or Researcher | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "270bbc560bc0872e-0"}}

The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus must be on the beneficiary's receipt of the major prizes or awards, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the prizes or awards. Second, USCIS determines whether the prizes or awards received are major ones and are for outstanding achievement in the academic field. Examples of qualifying rewards may include, but are not limited to: Awards from well-known national institutions or well-known professional associations; Certain doctoral dissertation awards; and Certain awards recognizing presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences. Considerations: Relevant considerations regarding whether the basis for granting the major prizes or awards for outstanding achievement in the academic field include, but are not limited to: The criteria used to grant the major prizes or awards; The number of prize recipients or awardees; and The pool of competitors. For example, an award available only to persons within a single locality, employer, or school may have little international recognition, while an award open to members of an internationally known and respected institution (including an R1 or R2 doctoral university [11] ) or professional organization may be internationally recognized. Criterion 2: Membership in associations in the academic field that require outstanding achievements of their members. [12] First, USCIS determines if the association for which the beneficiary claims membership requires outstanding achievements in the academic field. Examples of associations in the field requiring outstanding achievement of their members may include, but are not limited to: Membership in certain professional associations; and Fellowships with certain organizations or institutions. Considerations: The petitioner must show that membership in the association is based on the beneficiary's outstanding achievements in the academic field. Associations may have multiple levels of membership. The level of membership afforded to the beneficiary must show that it requires outstanding achievements in the academic field for which classification is sought. As a possible example, general membership in an international organization for engineering and technology professionals may not meet the requirements of the criterion. However, if that same organization at the fellow level requires, in part, that a nominee have accomplishments that have contributed importantly to the advancement or application of engineering, science, and technology, and that a council of experts and a committee of current fellows judges the nominations for fellows, that higher, fellow level may be qualifying. As another possible example, membership as a fellow in a scientific society dedicated to artificial intelligence is based on recognition of a nominee’s significant, sustained contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, and a panel of current fellows makes the selection of new fellows. Relevant factors that may lead to a conclusion that the beneficiary's membership in the association was not based on outstanding achievements in the academic field include, but are not limited to, instances where the beneficiary's membership was based: Solely on a level of education or years of experience in a particular field; or On the payment of a fee or by subscribing to an association's publications. Criterion 3: Published material in professional publications written by others about the beneficiary's work in the academic field. Such material must include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation. [13] First, USCIS determines whether the published material was about the beneficiary's work. Examples of qualifying published material may include, but are not limited to: Professional or major print publications (newspaper articles, popular and academic journal articles, books, textbooks, or similar publications) regarding the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work; Professional or major online publications regarding the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work; and Transcripts of professional or major audio or video coverage of the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work. Considerations: The published material should be about the beneficiary's work in the field, not just about the beneficiary’s employer or another organization that the beneficiary is associated with. Articles that cite the beneficiary's work as one of multiple footnotes or endnotes are not generally about the beneficiary's work. However, the beneficiary’s work need not be the only subject of the material; published material that covers a broader topic but includes a substantial discussion of the beneficiary’s work in the field may be considered material about the beneficiary’s work. Moreover, officers may consider material that focuses solely or primarily on work or research being undertaken by a team of which the beneficiary is", "metadata": {"id": "270bbc560bc0872e", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-3", "title": "Chapter 3 - Outstanding Professor or Researcher | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "270bbc560bc0872e-1"}}

Considerations: The published material should be about the beneficiary's work in the field, not just about the beneficiary’s employer or another organization that the beneficiary is associated with. Articles that cite the beneficiary's work as one of multiple footnotes or endnotes are not generally about the beneficiary's work. However, the beneficiary’s work need not be the only subject of the material; published material that covers a broader topic but includes a substantial discussion of the beneficiary’s work in the field may be considered material about the beneficiary’s work. Moreover, officers may consider material that focuses solely or primarily on work or research being undertaken by a team of which the beneficiary is a member, provided that the material mentions the beneficiary in connection with the work, or other evidence in the record documents the beneficiary’s significant role in the work or research. Evidence may include documentation such as print or online articles in professional publications or a transcript of professional audio or video coverage of the beneficiary’s work. Second, USCIS determines whether the publication qualifies as a professional publication. Evidence of published material in professional publications about the beneficiary should establish the circulation (online or in print) or viewership and the intended audience of the publication, as well as the title, date, and author of the material. Criterion 4: The beneficiary's participation, either individually or on a panel, as the judge of the work of others in the same or an allied academic field. [14] USCIS determines whether the beneficiary has participated, either individually or on a panel, as the judge of the work of others in the same or an allied academic field. Examples of qualifying judging experience may include, but are not limited to: Reviewer of abstracts or papers submitted for presentation at scholarly conferences in the respective field; Peer reviewer for scholarly publications; Member of doctoral dissertation committees; and Peer reviewer for government research funding programs. Considerations: The petitioner must show that the beneficiary has not only been invited to judge the work of others, but also that the beneficiary actually participated in the judging of the work of others in the same or allied academic field. For example, a petitioner might document a beneficiary’s peer review work by submitting a copy of a request from a journal to the beneficiary to do the review, accompanied by evidence confirming that the beneficiary actually completed the review. Criterion 5: The beneficiary's original scientific or scholarly research contributions to the academic field. [15] USCIS determines whether the beneficiary has made original scientific or scholarly research contributions to the academic field. Examples of relevant evidence of qualifying contributions may include, but are not limited to: Published materials about the significance of the beneficiary’s original work; Testimonials, letters, and affidavits about the beneficiary’s original work; Documentation that the beneficiary’s original work was cited at a level indicative of an original scientific or scholarly research contribution to an academic field; and Patents or licenses deriving from the beneficiary’s work or evidence of commercial use of the beneficiary’s work. Considerations: The regulations do not require that the beneficiary's contributions be of major significance. That said, the description of this type of evidence in the regulation does not simply require original research, but an original scientific or scholarly research contribution. [16] Moreover, the description of this type of evidence in the regulation requires that the contribution must be to the academic field, rather than an individual laboratory or institution. The regulations include a separate criterion for scholarly articles. [17] Therefore, contributions are a separate evidentiary requirement from scholarly articles. Possible items that could satisfy this criterion include, but are not limited to: Citation history or patterns for the beneficiary's work, as evidenced by number of citations, as well as an examination of the impact factor for the journals in which the beneficiary publishes. [18] While many scholars publish, not all are cited or publish in journals with significant impact factors. The petitioner may use web tools such as Google Scholar, SciFinder, and the Web of Science to establish the number of citations and the impact factor for journals; and Detailed letters from experts in the field explaining the nature and significance of the beneficiary’s contribution may also provide valuable context for evaluating whether the original work is a contribution to the academic field, particularly when the record includes documentation corroborating the claimed significance. Submitted letters should specifically describe the beneficiary’s contribution and its significance to the field and should also set forth the basis of the writer’s knowledge and expertise. Criterion 6: The beneficiary’s authorship of scholarly books or articles (in scholarly journals with international circulation) in the academic field. [19] First, USCIS determines whether the beneficiary has authored scholarly articles in the field. Examples of", "metadata": {"id": "270bbc560bc0872e", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-3", "title": "Chapter 3 - Outstanding Professor or Researcher | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "270bbc560bc0872e-2"}}

Submitted letters should specifically describe the beneficiary’s contribution and its significance to the field and should also set forth the basis of the writer’s knowledge and expertise. Criterion 6: The beneficiary’s authorship of scholarly books or articles (in scholarly journals with international circulation) in the academic field. [19] First, USCIS determines whether the beneficiary has authored scholarly articles in the field. Examples of qualifying publications may include, but are not limited to: Publications in professionally-relevant journals; and Published conference presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences. [20] Considerations: As defined in the academic arena, a scholarly article reports on original research, experimentation, or philosophical discourse. It is written by a researcher or expert in the field who is often affiliated with a college or university. Scholarly articles are also generally peer reviewed by other experts in the field of specialization. It should have footnotes, endnotes, or a bibliography, and may include graphs, charts, videos, or pictures as illustrations of the concepts expressed in the article. Second, USCIS determines whether the publication qualifies as a scholarly book or as a scholarly journal with international circulation in the academic field. Evidence of published material in scholarly journals with international circulation should establish that the circulation (online or in print) is, in fact, international, and who the intended audience of the publication is. Scholarly journals are typically written for a specialized audience often using technical jargon. Articles normally include an abstract, a description of methodology, footnotes, endnotes, and bibliography. Comparable evidence: Comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility if the standards do not readily apply. [21] USCIS determines if the evidence submitted is comparable to the evidence required in 8 CFR 204.5(i)(3)(i) . A petitioner for an outstanding professor or researcher does not need to establish that a particular standard is not readily applicable to the beneficiary's occupation. Instead, the petitioner may submit alternative, but qualitatively comparable evidence, if it establishes that the standards do not readily apply to that evidence. The existing evidentiary standards serve as a roadmap for determining, among other things, the quantity and types of evidence that should be submitted in order for such evidence to be considered “comparable.” [22] 2. Final Merits Determination Meeting the minimum requirement by providing at least two types of initial evidence does not, in itself, establish that the beneficiary in fact meets the requirements for classification as an outstanding professor or researcher. [23] Officers also consider the quality of the evidence. In the second step of the analysis in each case, officers should evaluate the evidence together when considering the petition in its entirety to make a final merits determination of whether or not the petitioner, by a preponderance of the evidence, has demonstrated that the beneficiary is recognized internationally as outstanding in a specific academic area. [24] At this step, officers consider any potentially relevant evidence, even if such evidence does not fit one of the above regulatory criteria or was not presented as comparable evidence. The officers consider all evidence in the totality. Some evidence may weigh more favorably on its own, while other evidence is more persuasive when viewed with other evidence. The following are examples of situations where evidence in the record may help officers evaluate the quality of the initial or comparable evidence to determine whether, in a totality analysis that considers all of the evidence, the beneficiary is internationally recognized as outstanding: [25] The record demonstrates that the beneficiary has published articles in highly-ranked journals relative to other journals in the field, as demonstrated by, for example, evidence the petitioner provides regarding the journal’s impact factor. [26] Depending on the level of recognition of the journals in question, as demonstrated by evidence in the record, there may be a high level of recognition associated with publication in such journals, especially if the beneficiary is the most significant contributor to the publication, a senior author, or the sole author of the article; The petitioner provides evidence demonstrating that the total rate of citations to the beneficiary’s body of published work is high relative to others in the field, such as the beneficiary has a high h-index [27] for the field. Depending on the field and the comparative data the petitioner provides, such evidence may indicate a beneficiary’s high overall standing for the purpose of demonstrating that the beneficiary enjoys international recognition as outstanding; [28] The petitioner documents the beneficiary’s employment or research experience is with leading institutions in the field (such", "metadata": {"id": "270bbc560bc0872e", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-3", "title": "Chapter 3 - Outstanding Professor or Researcher | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "270bbc560bc0872e-3"}}
{"text": "level of recognition associated with publication in such journals, especially if the beneficiary is the most significant contributor to the publication, a senior author, or the sole author of the article; The petitioner provides evidence demonstrating that the total rate of citations to the beneficiary’s body of published work is high relative to others in the field, such as the beneficiary has a high h-index [27] for the field. Depending on the field and the comparative data the petitioner provides, such evidence may indicate a beneficiary’s high overall standing for the purpose of demonstrating that the beneficiary enjoys international recognition as outstanding; [28] The petitioner documents the beneficiary’s employment or research experience is with leading institutions in the field (such as U.S. universities that have been recognized as having high or very high research activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, [29] foreign universities with comparably high research activity, or a university that is highly regarded according to a widely recognized metric such as the QS World University Rankings [30] ). Such employment or experience can be a positive factor toward demonstrating that the beneficiary enjoys international recognition as outstanding; The record establishes that the beneficiary has received unsolicited invitations to speak or present research at nationally or internationally recognized conferences in the field. Although such a role for the conference may not rise to the level of a leading or critical role, this type of invitation is generally indicative of a person’s recognition for achievements in the field; and The record establishes that the beneficiary is named as an investigator, scientist, or researcher on a peer-reviewed and competitively funded U.S. government grant or stipend for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research. This type of evidence can be a positive factor indicating a beneficiary is recognized internationally as outstanding in the beneficiary’s field. In all cases, the petitioner must provide sufficient context regarding the above evidence and considerations to demonstrate that the evidence meets the relevant criteria and to establish the beneficiary’s international recognition in the totality of the circumstances. This means that the petitioner must explain the significance of the submitted evidence, and how it demonstrates that the beneficiary is internationally recognized as outstanding. When requesting additional evidence or denying a petition, if the officer determines that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate eligibility, the officer should not merely make general assertions regarding this failure. Rather, the officer must articulate the specific reasons as to why the officer concludes that the petitioner, by a preponderance of the evidence, has not demonstrated that the beneficiary is an outstanding professor or researcher. [31] As with all adjudications, if an officer believes that the facts stated in the petition are not true, and can articulate why in the denial, then the officer denies the petition and explains the reasons in the written denial. [32] C. Qualifying Status of Employer Although a permanent labor certification is not required for the outstanding professor or researcher classification, the petitioner must provide an offer of employment as initial evidence in support of the petition. [33] The offer of employment must be in the form of a letter from the prospective U.S. employer to the beneficiary and the offer must state that the employer is offering the beneficiary employment in a tenured or tenure-track teaching position or a permanent research position in the beneficiary’s academic field. [34] In addition, the petitioner must demonstrate that it has the ability to pay the beneficiary’s salary. [35] The beneficiary of a petition for outstanding professor or researcher must be seeking to work for a university; an institution of higher education; or a department, division, or institute of a private employer if the department, division, or institute employs at least three persons full time in research activities and has achieved documented accomplishments in an academic field. [36] In general, positions with government agencies at the federal, state, or local level do not fit within the statutory framework unless the government agency is shown to be a U.S. university or an institution of higher learning. [37] Therefore, USCIS may only approve a petition for outstanding professor or researcher in instances where the offer of permanent employment is from a government agency if that agency can establish that it is a U.S. university or an institution of higher learning. Government agencies do not qualify as private employers. Government agencies that do not fit the statutory framework may have other available immigration avenues for offers of permanent employment to professors or researchers. For example, assuming all of the eligibility requirements for that visa preference category have been met, a government agency may file a petition for the person under the extraordinary ability classification.

For example, assuming all of the eligibility requirements for that visa preference category have been met, a government agency may file a petition for the person under the extraordinary ability classification. [38] D. Offer of Employment 1. Research Positions The petitioner must submit evidence to establish that the job offer is for a permanent research position. [39] Officers should not deny a petition where the employer is seeking an outstanding researcher solely because the actual employment contract or offer of employment does not contain a “good cause for termination” clause. The petitioning employer, however, must still establish that the offer of employment is intended to be of an indefinite or unlimited duration and that the nature of the position is such that the employee will ordinarily have an expectation of continued employment. For example, many research positions are funded by grant money received on a yearly basis. Researchers, therefore, are sometimes employed under employment contracts that are valid in 1-year increments. If the petitioning employer demonstrates, however, the intent to continue to seek funding and a reasonable expectation that funding will continue (such as demonstrated prior renewals for extended long-term research projects), such employment can be considered permanent within the meaning of the regulation. [40] Officers should also consider the circumstances surrounding the job offer as well as the benefits attached to the position. A position that appears to be limited to a specific term, such as in the example above, can meet the regulatory test if the position normally continues beyond the term (that is, if the funding grants are normally renewed). 2. Tenure or Tenure-Track Positions The determination as to whether a position qualifies as a tenured or a tenure-track position is not linked to the regulatory requirement that the position be permanent. [41] The definition of permanent applies only to research positions. Officers do not need to evaluate whether the employment contract for a tenured or tenure-track position has a “good cause for termination” clause and should not deny a petition seeking an outstanding professor for a tenured or tenure-track position on that basis alone. However, officers should evaluate whether the overall nature of the position is tenured or tenure-track. USCIS does not consider positions that are temporary, adjunct, limited duration fellowships, or similar positions where the employee has no reasonable expectation of long-term employment with the university, to be tenured or tenure-track positions.

See Kazarian v. USCIS (PDF) , 596 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 2010). USCIS has interpreted Kazarian as applicable to outstanding professor and researcher petitions. [25] Not all cases will have such evidence, nor is such evidence required for the petitioner to demonstrate eligibility. Additionally, the examples provided are a non-exhaustive list. While the listed factors may be especially relevant to beneficiaries in STEM fields, the guidance applies to all professors and researchers. [26] Impact factor is commonly used as a measure of a journal’s influence; it represents the average number of citations received per article published in that journal during the 2 preceding years. See Garfield, E, The History and Meaning of the Journal Impact Factor , Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 295, Iss. 1, p. 90 (2006). [27] The h-index is an example of a tool for measuring a researcher’s output and impact. It is based on the highest number of the researcher’s publications that have been cited at least that same number of times. For example, if a researcher has an h-index of 10, it means the researcher has 10 publications that have 10 or more citations each (but not 11 publications with at least 11 citations each). See Hirsch, J, An Index to Quantify an Individual’s Scientific Research Output , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 102, Iss. 46, p. 16569 (2005). Other indices for measuring output and impact are also used. When relying on any of these tools, a petitioner should explain its methodology and significance with supporting documentation because the sources for the data and the duration of time involved in the calculation can impact the actual h-index value. [28] This factor is less relevant for beneficiaries early in their career, as such persons have had less time to accumulate citations but may nevertheless have garnered acclaim and risen to the small percentage at the top of the field as demonstrated by other evidence in the record. As stated above, none of the listed factors are required to demonstrate eligibility.

USCIS automatically issues an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to principal petitioners upon the approval of the U nonimmigrant status petition. [1] The statute only allows 10,000 U nonimmigrant visas to be issued every fiscal year. [2] If the number of approvable petitions exceeds 10,000, USCIS places the approvable petitions on a waiting list. Once they are on the waiting list, USCIS grants deferred action or, in limited circumstances, parole to U-1 principal petitioners and qualifying family members and, as a matter of discretion, may authorize employment for such petitioners and qualifying family members. [3] USCIS generally provides such employment authorization under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14) . Under the existing regulatory structure, aliens with pending petitions are currently unable to apply for employment authorization before waiting list placement. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA 2008), signed into law on December 23, 2008, amended Section 214(p)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to provide DHS with discretion to grant employment authorization to an alien who has a pending, bona fide petition for U nonimmigrant status. [4] Though permitted by statute, DHS had not previously implemented a process for providing such employment authorization, separate from the existing regulatory waiting list, before June 14, 2021. The permissive language of INA 214(p)(6) does not require the agency to create a separate employment authorization process. However, because of drastic increases in the volume of U nonimmigrant petitions and a growing backlog, USCIS decided to exercise its discretion to conduct bona fide determinations (BFD) and provide EADs and deferred action to aliens with pending, bona fide petitions who meet certain discretionary standards, beginning on June 14, 2021. INA 103(a) grants the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to enforce the immigration laws and provides general authority for deferred action. The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that decisions made to either initiate or terminate enforcement proceedings are under the purview of the Executive Branch, [5] and therefore fall within DHS’s authority. The Executive Branch has exercised its discretion to grant deferred action, and the federal courts have consistently recognized the existence of this authority, since the mid-1970s. [6] While USCIS has approved the statutory maximum of petitions each year since Fiscal Year 2010, the increasing number of petitions and complexity of the adjudication resulted in increased processing times. USCIS attempted to keep up with this increase by shifting resources as well as hiring and training new officers; yet, despite these attempts, the burden quickly outpaced resources given competing demands and priorities across the agency. Consequently, the number of remaining pending petitions after the annual cap was reached grew dramatically. Though the waiting list was initially conceived to address the gap between petitions filed and available visas, USCIS’ ability to adjudicate pending petitions for placement on the waiting list has been and continues to be outmatched by the steady number of new filings. To illustrate, in 2009, USCIS received 6,850 principal petitions; in 2020, 22,358 principal petitions were filed. From 2015-2018, over 30,000 principal petitions were filed annually. [7] The pending backlog, and the corresponding delay in adjudication time, is due to the increase in U visa filings overall, the complexity of the adjudication, the statutory cap mandated by Congress, and the agency’s priorities and limited resources. As of June 14, 2021, USCIS is unable to adjudicate the tens of thousands of petitions for the waiting list, as well as completing full adjudication for the 10,000 principal visas available under the statutory cap, in a single fiscal year without incurring a negative impact in other humanitarian programs and fee-based applications or petitions. Taking into consideration the overall filings increase and the numerous adjudications USCIS is responsible for, USCIS must allocate resources among the competing adjudicative priorities and balance the number of resources that can be assigned to the U visa program. Additionally, as of June 14, 2021, USCIS is facing substantial litigation fueled by the years-long wait times for petitioners to be placed on the waiting list and obtain U nonimmigrant status due to the number of new petitions filed each year exceeding the statutory cap. Case review has revealed that most U nonimmigrant petitioners do not have lawful immigration status and are not otherwise authorized to work, so they may be vulnerable during the lengthy adjudication period. USCIS recognizes concerns regarding such vulnerability raised by stakeholders and believes implementing the statute’s authorization to provide EADs to those with pending, bona fide petitions better aligns the U program with its dual purpose as envisioned by Congress: stabilizing victims of crime and serving as a tool for law enforcement. [8] In addition, the BFD process enables USCIS to review petitions more efficiently, and provide the benefits of employment authorization and deferred action to more petitioners in a shorter", "metadata": {"id": "bcba71233c73d5e7", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-3", "title": "Volume 3 - Humanitarian Protection and Parole | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "bcba71233c73d5e7-1"}}

USCIS recognizes concerns regarding such vulnerability raised by stakeholders and believes implementing the statute’s authorization to provide EADs to those with pending, bona fide petitions better aligns the U program with its dual purpose as envisioned by Congress: stabilizing victims of crime and serving as a tool for law enforcement. [8] In addition, the BFD process enables USCIS to review petitions more efficiently, and provide the benefits of employment authorization and deferred action to more petitioners in a shorter time period than the waiting list process alone, which requires a full adjudicative review of eligibility for nonimmigrant status. USCIS notes that from FY 2009 through FY 2020, over 75 percent of fully adjudicated Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status ( Form I-918 ) have been approved. [9] Therefore, under this policy, USCIS deems a petition “bona fide” when USCIS determines that the Form I-918 is complete and properly filed [10] and has received the result of the petitioner’s biometrics. Because INA 214(p)(6) gives the Secretary of Homeland Security, and USCIS as the Secretary's designee, discretion to issue employment authorization to pending, bona fide principal petitioners and qualifying family members, USCIS also considers whether the principal petitioners or qualifying family members appear to pose a risk to national security [11] or public safety, and otherwise merit a favorable exercise of discretion. The EAD and deferred action that USCIS issues for these cases is valid for 4 years, subject to termination if USCIS determines a national security or public safety concern has arisen, or a determination that the BFD EAD is no longer warranted, or that the prior BFD EAD and deferred action was issued in error. USCIS issues BFD EADs under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14) because recipients of BFD EADs also receive deferred action. Furthermore, there is currently no other EAD category specifically designated for principal petitioners and qualifying family members with pending, bona fide petitions. INA 214(p)(6) provides the statutory foundation for the implementation of the BFD process, and explicitly speaks to the granting of employment authorization. As such, petitioners granted BFD EADs receive employment authorization documents under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14) B. Administrative Procedure Act Considerations The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) excepts interpretive rules; general statements of policy; and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice and comment requirements. [12] On June 14, 2021, USCIS updated the Policy Manual to notify the public of its interpretation of “bona fide application” at INA 214(p)(6) , its exercise of discretion under that provision, and explain its policy for issuing such EADs and granting deferred action. USCIS’ interpretation is reasonable because “bona fide” generally means “made in good faith; without fraud or deceit.” [13] In this context, USCIS interprets the bona fide standard [14] as being met once the entire petition (including the required certification on Form I-918, Supplement B ) is properly filed and biometrics are submitted and received. The completion of the Supplement B by a law enforcement official or judge provides an appropriate assurance of the bona fide nature of the petition in this context. Likewise, because INA 214(p)(6) gives USCIS discretionary authority to issue such employment authorization, it is reasonable, in the exercise of such discretion, to assess security checks to determine whether petitioners may pose a threat to national security or public safety before according benefits under this section. The Policy Manual guidance explains and provides clarification to officers but does not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights or obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS evaluates applications for immigration benefit requests. 1. Unfair Surprise and Reliance Interests An agency changing its interpretation of a regulation should consider, among other factors, whether the interpretative change creates unfair surprise. [15] USCIS is issuing this guidance to clarify what the law and regulations permit or require. USCIS is not restricting the program for pending petitioners; rather, USCIS is using its statutory authority to provide an additional pathway to employment authorization and deferred action. Pending petitioners will not be treated in a disparate or unfair manner, as the evaluation for an EAD is based on the initial evidence petitioners must submit when filing a Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status ( Form I-918 This process does not create an undue burden on pending or future petitioners, as it does not change any evidentiary requirement.

Rather, it utilizes the filing system already in place to issue benefits to Form I-918 petitioners and mitigate any vulnerabilities they may face due to the lengthy adjudicatory wait times. Additionally, those who are not granted BFD EADs and deferred action under the first phase of review proceed to the full waiting list adjudication, thereby receiving the same adjudicative review they would have had before this policy implementation. Consequently, the new policy only has an adverse impact on overseas derivatives where the principal petitioner resides in the U.S. USCIS notes that overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members would not benefit from this EAD and deferred action process because they are not physically located in the United States. Neither deferred action nor employment authorization are accorded to aliens or qualifying family members outside the United States. USCIS considered the potential impact to such petitioners and determined that offering employment authorization and deferred action to the majority of petitioners (as a majority of Form I-918 petitioners are physically located in the United States), coupled with the statutory authority to provide employment to pending, bona fide petitioners, provides numerous benefits. Additionally, USCIS does not anticipate that overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members would be harmed by this process, since the agency continues to conduct full waiting list adjudications for overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members, as the agency has previously done. Consequently, this policy has no adverse impact upon overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members. USCIS notes that there will be adverse impacts to overseas qualifying family members where the principal petitioner is in the United States; if the principal petitioner receives the BFD EAD and deferred action, there is not a sufficient basis to conduct a waiting list adjudication for the qualifying family member. However, USCIS believes the overall benefits of this policy change outweigh the adverse impacts. The BFD process only provides a basic review of the principal petition for U nonimmigrant status, and does not require the petitioner to establish eligibility for U nonimmigrant status but for visa availability in a given fiscal year under the statutory cap. USCIS cannot provide different levels of adjudication to a principal petitioner and the petitioner's qualifying family members. Advancing qualifying family members to an adjudicative phase beyond that of the principal petitioner would conflict with the INA’s requirement that the qualifying family members be “accompanying or following to join” the principal petitioner, and in addition would be confusing and difficult to administer. [16] USCIS also considered providing petitioners in the United States who have overseas beneficiaries the option of forgoing the BFD process for a waiting list adjudication; however, this would create multiple adjudicatory tracks and result in operational inefficiencies that this policy change was meant to eliminate. USCIS recognizes that 8 CFR 214.14(d)(2) states, “After U-1 nonimmigrant status has been issued to qualifying petitioners on the waiting list, any remaining U-1 nonimmigrant numbers for that fiscal year will be issued to new qualifying petitioners in the order that the petitions were properly filed.” Historically, USCIS has interpreted and applied this provision to mean that it will grant visas to those on the waiting list, based on the date the petition was filed, before granting visas to those not on the waiting list. Yet the regulation also clearly states “the oldest petitions receiving the highest priority” for such cap numbers. Under this policy, as part of the first phase of review, USCIS issues EADs and deferred action to aliens in the United States with a bona fide petition, instead of placing them in the queue for a waiting list adjudication. Those who do not receive an EAD under the first phase proceed to the full waiting list adjudication. That is, if their petitions are approvable, they are placed on the waiting list to receive an EAD and deferred action. As these two tracks receive the same benefits (EAD and deferred action), the most equitable path is to continue to issue visas based on the date a petition is filed, regardless of whether a petitioner is placed on the waiting list or not. USCIS believes this approach best implements the regulatory provision and statute, and provides the greatest benefit to all petitioners, without adversely impacting any petitioner.

USCIS believes this approach best implements the regulatory provision and statute, and provides the greatest benefit to all petitioners, without adversely impacting any petitioner. USCIS considered the alternative of continuing to adjudicate petitions on the waiting list first, before those with BFD EADs, but believes that would be inequitable and in conflict with the regulatory language directing that the oldest petitions receive the highest priority. Most of those with BFD EADs will never be placed on the waiting list. To make them wait behind all petitioners on the current waiting list regardless of filing date, and to prioritize those placed on the waiting list in the future, would effectively penalize those who were able to receive BFD EADs because they had properly filed a complete Form I-918 that did not raise any public safety or national security risks. Accordingly, USCIS will adjudicate petitions for U nonimmigrant status in date-filed order, drawing from both BFD EAD recipients and petitioners on the waiting list. 2. Criminal History Check for Bona Fide Determination Employment Authorization Documents Before June 14, 2021, USCIS officers considered criminal history background checks when adjudicating a Form I-918 petition: first, for waiting list placement and second, for the final adjudication when a visa has become available. USCIS continues to evaluate whether a principal petitioner or a qualifying family member may maintain a BFD EAD and grant of deferred action throughout the 4-year validity period until final adjudication for U nonimmigrant status; however, as of June 14, 2021, USCIS will review and update background and security checks at regular intervals during the validity period of a principal petitioner or qualifying family member’s BFD EAD and deferred action. USCIS also retains discretion to update background and security checks at any time when case-specific circumstances warrant. By reviewing updated background and security checks at regular intervals during the validity period, USCIS will ensure the petitioner continues to pose no risk to public safety and national security. USCIS does not believe this review would adversely impact any petitioner’s reliance interests or raise retroactivity concerns, as the checks are already run regularly. Additionally, implementing these checks allows USCIS to maintain a balance between providing employment authorization to eligible immigrant victims of crime and ensuring the security of the United States. Finally, any public safety and national security issues raised anew after a BFD EAD and deferred action have been granted will be fully evaluated during the waiting list adjudication, under the same adjudicative review as would have occurred before this policy implementation. C. Implementation USCIS began implementing this policy on June 14, 2021. This policy applies to all Form I-918 petitions pending on June 14, 2021, as well as Form I-918 petitions filed on or after that date. The guidance contained in the Policy Manual is controlling and supersedes any related prior guidance. Footnotes [^ 1] See 8 CFR 214.14(c)(7) .

[^ 9] See Number of Form I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status By Fiscal Year, Quarter, and Case Status (Fiscal Years 2009-2020) [^ 10] This includes all required initial evidence, except the Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant ( Form I-192 ). One of the main purposes for issuing employment authorization to those with pending, bona fide petitions is to provide EADs to good faith petitioners who are vulnerable due to lengthy wait times. Requiring and adjudicating the Form I-192 for purposes of the EAD would delay the EAD adjudication and undermine the efficiency goals of this change. Instead of adjudicating the Form I-192 at this stage, USCIS relies on criminal history checks. [^ 11] See INA 212(a)(3) [^ 12] See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) [^ 13] See Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). [^ 14] USCIS considered different potential definitions of “bona fide” and ultimately determined that this definition was best suited to this context. USCIS specifically considered the criteria for the “bona fide determination” at 8 CFR 214.11(e), regarding alien victims of severe forms of trafficking, but ultimately decided not to adopt those criteria because of the differences between the U and T visa requirements, such as the law enforcement certification requirement for U nonimmigrant petitioners. See INA 214(p)(1) 8 CFR 214.14(c)(2)(i) . The completion of the Supplement B by a law enforcement official or judge provides an appropriate assurance of the bona fide nature of the petition in this context. Additionally, the T regulation requires consideration of waivers of inadmissibility, for which an RFE is often required. This would significantly delay the U BFD adjudication, contrary to Congress’ likely intent in authorizing the issuance of this interim benefit. It would also undermine the procedural efficiencies this policy was intended to create in comparison with the waiting list process. [^ 15] See Long Island Care at Home Ltd. v.

Threats of harm or serious harm: United States v. Dann (PDF) , 652 F.3d 1160, 1170 (9th Cir. 2011) (Threats should be considered from the vantage point of a reasonable person in the place of the victim and must be sufficiently serious to compel that person to remain.). United States v. Farrell , 563 F.3d 364, 372 n.3 (8th Cir. 2009) (“Jury Instruction 16 defined ‘involuntary servitude’ as follows: ‘[A] condition of compulsory service in which the alleged victim is compelled to perform labor or services against the alleged victim's will for the benefit of another person due to the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment. . . The use or threat of a civil lawsuit does not make the labor involuntary.’”). United States v. Djoumessi (PDF) , 538 F.3d 547 (6th Cir. 2008) (“The term ‘involuntary servitude’ necessarily means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process. This definition encompasses those cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing the victim in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion.”) (quoting United States v. Kozminski , 487 U.S. 931, 952 (1988)). United States v. Bradley (PDF) , 390 F.3d 145, 153 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 545 U.S. 1101 (2005) (The use of “physical restraint; such as, the use of chains, barbed wire, or locked doors,” is not required in order to establish the offense of forced labor.). United States v. Warren (PDF) , 772 F.2d 827, 834 (11th Cir. 1985) (“That the worker had the opportunity to escape is of no moment, if the defendant has placed him in such fear of physical harm that he is afraid to leave.”).

Abuse or threatened abuse of legal process: Clyatt v. United States (PDF) , 197 U.S. 207 (1905) (victim was coerced by threat of legal sanction to work off a debt to a master). United States v. Reynolds (PDF) , 235 U.S. 133 (1914) (when breach of the labor contract is criminalized, requiring a misdemeanor offender to work for a surety who would, in turn, pay the convict’s fine to the state, the condition of peonage is created). Pollock v. Williams (PDF) , 322 U.S. 4 (1944) (“[The State] must respect the constitutional and statutory command that it may not make failure to labor in discharge of a debt any part of a crime. It may not directly or indirectly command involuntary servitude, even if it was voluntarily contracted for.”). Bailey v. Alabama (PDF) , 219 U.S. 219 (1911) (subjecting debtors to prosecution and criminal punishment for failing to perform labor after receiving an advance payment). United States v.

United States v. Farrell , 563 F.3d 364, 372-73 (8th Cir. 2009) (in upholding conviction for peonage, finding that employers used threats of arrest and imprisonment based on the victim’s lack of immigration status). United States v. Djoumessi (PDF) , 538 F.3d 547, 553 (6th Cir. 2008) (upholding involuntary servitude conviction when coercion involved threats of deportation to Cameroon which victim considered the greatest threat against her because of the conditions there and her desire to help her family through opportunities in the United States). United States v. Veerapol , 312 F.3d 1128, 1130-31 (9th Cir. 2002) (upholding involuntary servitude conviction and noting that the employer maintained control over Thai restaurant workers through a variety of methods of coercion, including threats of imprisonment based on the workers’ lack of immigration status). United States v. Calimlim , 538 F.3d 706, 713 (7th Cir. 2008) (finding that the employer’s actions of keeping victim’s passport, never admitting they were violating law, or offering to try and regularize the worker’s presence in the United States and implicit threats that she may be subject to deportation proceedings constituted “abuse of law”). United States v. Calimlim , 538 F.3d 706, 713 (7th Cir. 2008) (rejecting employer’s arguments that threatening deportation was not an “abuse of law” because worker was here without immigration status and thus subject to deportation and finding employers’ threats were directed to an end different from those envisioned by the law and were thus an abuse of legal process). Nunag-Tanedo v. E. Baton Rouge Par. Sch. Bd. , 790 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1144 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (citing principle that abuse of legal process occurs when objective for threats is to intimidate and coerce forced labor). Ruiz v. Fernandez , 949 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1077 (E.D. Wash. 2013) (rejecting defendants’ arguments that threats to report H2A Chilean sheepherders were justified because, if workers left the ranch without being assigned to another member ranch, they would be in violation of their temporary work visas. Workers testified that threats were made almost daily and were apparently made in relation to victims' general willingness to do specific work on the ranch rather any sort of expressed intent to leave the ranch without obtaining a transfer.).

And that involuntary portion would suffice to sustain the conviction.”). United States v. Dann (PDF) , 652 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir. 2001) (The charge of forced labor need not apply to the entire duration of the victim’s services or labor.

The law under which an adopted child may have obtained citizenship is the law that was in effect [1] while the adopted child was under the age of 18. [2] Additionally, adoptees who did not obtain citizenship through their adoptive parents may obtain citizenship under a different law. [3] Citizenship and Naturalization Laws (Before October 5, 1978) Before October 5, 1978, there were no statutory provisions that provided for the automatic acquisition of citizenship by adopted children through their adoptive parents (unless the child was adopted by their biological father and the adoption legitimated the child). An adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship if the adoptive parents applied for naturalization on the adopted child’s behalf. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 323), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18. Citizenship and Naturalization Laws (October 5, 1978 - February 27, 2001) [4] Adoptive Parents Were U.S. Citizens at Time of Adoption If the adoptive parents were both U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, there was no path for an adopted child to automatically derive citizenship through them. The adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship through the child’s U.S. citizen adoptive parent(s), if the adoptive parent(s) applied for a Certificate of Naturalization or a Certificate of Citizenship on the adopted child’s behalf (under former INA 322). The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 322), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18 (unless waived). Adoptive Parent(s) Naturalized After Adoption If the adoptive parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, or one parent was a U.S. citizen and one was not, and the alien parent(s) later became naturalized U.S. citizens before the adopted child turned 18, the adopted child may have automatically derived citizenship. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 320 or 321). If the adopted child automatically derived citizenship under former INA 320 or 321, they may file Application for Certificate of Citizenship ( Form N-600 ), to seek documentation of their citizenship, or they may apply for a U.S. passport with the Department of State to serve as evidence of their U.S. citizenship. The following table provides an overview of how previous provisions for automatic derivation of citizenship apply to adopted children. Previous Derivation of Citizenship Provisions Applicability to Adopted Children Period in which the Last Action Took Place [5] Citizenship Status of Adoptive Parent(s) Derivation of Citizenship for Adopted Children [6] Before Dec. 24, 1952 N/A Adopted children cannot derive U.S. citizenship. On or After Dec. 24, 1952 and Before Oct. 5, 1978 N/A Adopted children cannot derive U.S. citizenship, unless adopted by their biological father and adoption legitimates the child. However, adoptive parent(s) could apply for naturalization on behalf of certain adopted children. [7] On or After Oct. 5, 1978 and Before Feb. 27, 2001 Adoptive parent(s) were U.S. citizens at time of adoption If the adoptive parent(s) were both U.S. citizens at the time of the child’s adoption, there was no path for the adoptee to derive citizenship through the adoptive parent(s). However, adoptive parent(s) could apply for naturalization on behalf of certain adopted children. [8] To obtain citizenship based on an adoptive relationship, the child must have been adopted by a certain age depending on the period of last action.

{"text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Background A. Purpose The F and M nonimmigrant visa categories are for aliens seeking to study in the United States. The nonimmigrant academic student (F-1) classification allows an alien to enter the United States as a full-time student at a U.S. college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, private elementary school, other academic institution, or in a language training program. [1] The nonimmigrant vocational student (M-1) classification includes students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic programs, excluding language training programs. [2] B. Background The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is the primary body of law governing immigration and visa operations and provides for the admission of various classes of nonimmigrants, including foreign students. [3] The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) created the requirement for a program to collect information for tracking and monitoring foreign students from approved institutions of higher education, other approved educational institutions, and designated exchange visitor programs in the United States. [4] IIRIRA led to legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiating a pilot program in 1997 to monitor the academic progress and movement of foreign students and exchange visitors from entry into the United States to departure. This program was known as the Coordinated Interagency Partnership Regulating International Students (CIPRIS). As part of reforms following September 11, 2001, legacy INS renamed CIPRIS to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Legacy INS also established the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to manage SEVIS. [5] IIRIRA, as amended by the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, required that legacy INS establish an electronic means to monitor and verify the acceptance of alien students by schools. The amended IIRIRA also mandated that schools notify legacy INS when a foreign student fails to enroll within 30 days after the end of a school’s enrollment period. [6] The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the authority and functions of legacy INS into the newly created DHS. [7] Those functions relating to SEVIS and SEVP were placed within ICE. In 2004, DHS published a final rule amending regulations requiring payment of a fee by certain aliens seeking status as F-1, F-3, M-1 or M-3 nonimmigrant students. [8] In 2008, DHS again amended its regulations and adjusted application fees for that certain aliens who are seeking status as F-1, F-3, M-1, or M-3 nonimmigrant students. [9] On December 14, 2010, President Obama signed the Accreditation of English Language Training Programs Act, which amended INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) to state that F-1 nonimmigrant students intending to pursue an English language training course of study must enroll in an English language training program that has been accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. [10] C.

See 22 CFR 41.61(b)(1) [^ 3] According to INA 101(a)(15)(f) , an alien is eligible for an F visa if they: have a residence in foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning, are a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course of study and who seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study consistent with INA 214(l) at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program in the United States. INA 101(a)(15)(m) provides that an alien who has a residence in a foreign country which they have no intention of abandoning who seeks to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing a full course at an established vocational or other recognized institution (other than in a language training program) in the United States is eligible for an M visa.

{"text": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements A. Applicant Eligibility To be eligible for F-1 or M-1 status, aliens must meet the following requirements: [1] Be bona fide students qualified to pursue a full course of study; Seek to enter the United States temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study at an institution the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) has certified to admit nonimmigrant students; Have a foreign residence, which they have no intention of abandoning; [2] Have a Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status ( Form I-20 ) issued in their name by a Designated School Official (DSO) of a school that SEVP has certified to admit nonimmigrant students; [3] Have sufficient funds available for self-support during the entire proposed course of study; [4] and Provide proof that the alien has paid the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee on Payment of Fee Remittance for Certain F, J, and M Nonimmigrants (Form I-901), if applicable. [5] Intent to Depart In order to be eligible for F-1 or M-1 classification, a student must intend to depart from the United States after their temporary period of stay (for example, upon completion of their program of study and any authorized practical training in this country or upon termination of their nonimmigrant status) and have a foreign residence that they have no intention of abandoning. [6] The foreign residence requirement should be adjudicated differently for students than for other nonimmigrants. [7] Typically, students lack the strong economic and social ties of more established applicants, and they plan longer stays in the United States. INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) assumes that the natural circumstances of being a student do not disqualify the student from qualifying for nonimmigrant status. Considerations should include the student’s present intent, not what they might do after a lengthy stay in the United States. [8] If a student had a foreign residence immediately prior to traveling to the United States, even if such residence was with parents or guardians, they may be considered to be maintaining a residence abroad if they have the present intent to depart the United States at the conclusion of their studies. [9] The fact that this intention may change is not a sufficient reason to deny them F classification. In addition, the present intent to depart does not imply the need to return to the country from which they hold a passport. It means only that they must intend to leave the United States upon completion of their studies. Given that most students are young, they are not expected to have a long-range plan and may not be able to fully explain their plans at the conclusion of their studies. The student must have the present intent to depart at the conclusion of their approved activities. [10] A student may be the beneficiary of an approved or pending permanent labor certification application or immigrant petition and still be able to demonstrate their intention to depart after a temporary period of stay. [11] USCIS officers generally view the fact that a student is the beneficiary of an approved or pending permanent labor certification or an immigrant visa petition as not necessarily impacting their eligibility for the classification, so long as the student intends to depart at the end of their temporary period of stay. In all cases, the officer must consider all facts presented when determining whether a student is eligible for the F or M classification. Sufficient Funds F-1 students must have sufficient funds to successfully study in the United States without resorting to unauthorized U.S. employment for financial support. F-1 students must provide documentary evidence that sufficient funds are, or will be, available to defray all expenses during the entire period of anticipated study. [12] M-1 students must establish that they have funds immediately available to them or assurances of support necessary to pay all tuition and living costs for the entire period of intended stay. Evidence of financial ability for prospective F-1 and M-1 students includes, but is not limited to: Family bank statements; Documentation from a sponsor; Financial aid letters; Scholarship letters; and A letter from an employer showing annual salary. [13] B. Program Eligibility 1. F-1 Students The following schools may be approved for attendance by F-1 students: [14] A college or university; [15] A community college or junior college which provides instruction in the liberal arts or in the professions and which awards recognized associate degrees; [16] A seminary; [17] A conservatory; [18] An academic high school; [19] A private elementary school; [20] and An institution which provides language training, instruction in liberal arts or fine arts, instruction in the professions, or instruction or training in more than one of these disciplines. [21] 2. M-1 Students The following schools", "metadata": {"id": "7d1bf5b7df1f400a", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-f-chapter-2", "title": "Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements | USCIS", "agency": "USCIS", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "7d1bf5b7df1f400a-0"}}

[21] 2. M-1 Students The following schools may be approved for attendance by M-1 students: [22] A community college or junior college which provides vocational or technical training and which awards recognized associate degrees; [23] A vocational high school; [24] and A school which provides vocational or nonacademic training other than language training. [25] 3. Ineligible School Types The following schools may not be approved for attendance by foreign students: [26] A home school; [27] A public elementary or middle school; [28] and Adult education programs that are funded in whole or in part by a grant under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or by any other federal, state, county, or municipal funding. [29] 4. Designated School Official Responsibilities One requirement for a school to be ICE SEVP-certified is that the school must have dedicated employees for assisting and overseeing enrolled F and M students. These dedicated employees are referred to as the DSO. Each instructional site location must have at least one DSO who also serves as the main point of contact related to the school’s compliance for ICE SEVP. [30] DSOs oversee and authorize foreign student activities, such as, but not limited to, reduced course loads, leaves of absence, employment endorsements such as for Curricular Practical Training and Optional Practical Training, and school transfers. DSOs are also responsible for fulfilling reporting requirements related to the activities of the school’s foreign students. Federal law requires DSOs to update and maintain student records in the SEVIS. [31] The failure of a DSO to report student infractions properly and in a timely manner can result in disqualification of the individual as a DSO and withdrawal of the school’s ICE SEVP certification. C. Border Commuter Students Nationals of Canada or Mexico who continue to reside in their home country while commuting to the United States to attend an approved F or M school are generally granted F-3 or M-3 nonimmigrant classification. [32] Such border commuter students are specifically permitted to engage in either full-time or part-time studies. [33] Unlike other foreign students who are admitted for duration of status, commuter students are admitted with a fixed period of admission through a specific date.

{"text": "Chapter 3 - Courses and Enrollment, Full Course of Study, and Reduced Course Load A. Public High School While F-1 and M-1 students may not attend a public elementary or middle school or a publicly funded adult education program, they may attend public high school. [1] If F-1 or M-1 students are admitted for a fixed period of admission (not for duration of status) to attend a public high school and then apply to transfer schools or to attend a U.S. post-secondary school, they need to file an Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status ( Form I-539 ) to request an extension of stay to remain in the United States beyond their fixed period of admission. 1. F-1 Students F-1 students are limited to a cumulative period of 12 months to attend a public high school. [2] F-1 high school students are typically admitted for a specific period of time rather than duration of status. [3] F-1 students must provide proof that they have reimbursed the local educational agency that administers the public high school for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education at the school for the period of the student’s attendance. 2. M-1 Students M-1 students are not subject to the same 12-month time limit on public high school attendance. However, M-1 students are admitted for a fixed time period that includes the period necessary to complete the course of study indicated on the Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status ( Form I-20 ), plus practical training following completion of the course of study, plus an additional 30 days to depart the United States, but not to exceed a total period of 1 year. [4] B. Online and Distance Education Courses 1. F-1 Students An F-1 student enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours may only count one class or three credits (or the equivalent) per academic session (or the equivalent) toward the full course of study requirement if the class is: Taken online; or Through distance education not requiring physical attendance for any purpose integral to completion of the class. [5] If the F-1 student’s course of study is in a language study program, no online or distance education classes count toward a student’s full course of study program. [6] If the F-1 student needs only one course to finish the program of study, it cannot be taken through online or distance education. Courses must have a physical presence requirement. [7] 2. M-1 Students No online or distance education classes are counted toward an M-1 student’s full course of study requirement if such classes do not require the student’s physical attendance for any purpose integral to completion of the class. [8] For purposes of the M classification, an online or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. [9] C. Other Education Programs 1. Adult Education Programs An F-1 or M-1 student may not enroll in an adult education program if it is funded in whole or in part by the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act or by any other federal, state, county, or municipal funding. [10] 2. English Language Training Programs F-1 Students F-1 students intending to pursue an English language training course of study must enroll in an English language training program that has been accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. [11] English language training online or distance learning courses do not count towards the full course of study requirement. [12] Time spent in an English language training program also does not count towards the completion of one full academic year as an F-1 student. [13] However, if the student is receiving college credit for the language training at a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified college or university, then the time counts towards the one academic year required to participate in a practical training program. [14] M-1 Students M-1 students are only permitted to engage in English language training if their primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training and they are taking English language training at the same school solely for the purpose of being able to understand the vocational or technical course of study. [15] D. Concurrent Enrollment An F-1 student may enroll in two different SEVP-certified schools at one time if the combined enrollment amounts to a full course of study. [16] In cases where a student is concurrently enrolled, the school from which the student will earn the student’s degree or certification should issue the Form I-20 , and conduct subsequent certifications and updates to the Form I-20. [17] M-1 students may not be enrolled in two different SEVP-certified schools. E.

Full Course of Study DHS regulations require students to maintain a full course of study and that the successful completion of the full course of study leads to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. [18] Full course of study requirements are different for F and M students. 1. F-1 Students To qualify as a full course of study, the Designated School Official (DSO) must have previously certified as a full course of study one of the following, as appropriate: [19] Postgraduate or postdoctoral study at a college or university; [20] Undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or religious seminary; [21] Undergraduate study at a college or university consisting of at least 12 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, and where all students enrolled for a minimum of 12 semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) SEVP in the school certification process) unless those students will complete their course of study during the current term with fewer semester or quarter hours; [22] Postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational program for which a school must confer recognized associate or other degrees upon its graduates or establish that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning meeting specific requirements; [23] Any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational training program consisting of at least 18 clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or consists of at least 22 clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; [24] Curriculum at an approved private elementary or middle school or public or private academic high school consisting of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation. [25] 2. M-1 Students To qualify as a full course of study, the DSO must have previously certified as a full course of study one of the following, as appropriate: Community college or junior college studies consisting of at least 12 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, and where all students enrolled for a minimum of 12 semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by ICE SEVP in the school certification process) except when the students need a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term; [26] Postsecondary vocational or business school programs, other than in a language training program, [27] which confer upon their graduates recognized associate or other degrees or have established that their credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: a school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a state or political subdivision; or a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and consisting of at least 12 hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by ICE SEVP in the school certification process; [28] Vocational or other nonacademic curriculum studies, other than in a language training program, [29] consisting of at least 18 hours of attendance a week if the main part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or at least 22 hours a week if the main part of the course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; [30] Vocational or other nonacademic high school curriculum, consisting of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.

[31] 3. Border Commuter Students A border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study, even though on a part-time basis, leading to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. A DSO at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a reduced course load below the requirements for a full course of study. The reduced course load must be consistent with the border commuter student’s certified course of study. [32] F. Reduced Course Load 1. F-1 Students To maintain status while on a reduced course load, the F-1 student must first obtain authorization from the DSO before dropping to a reduced course load. A student who drops below a full course of study without the prior approval of the DSO is considered out of status. [33] A DSO may authorize an F-1 student for a reduced course load for one of the following reasons. Specified Initial Academic Difficulties A DSO may authorize a reduced course load due to academic difficulties once while the student is pursuing a course of study at that program level. [34] A student authorized to drop below a full course of study for academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at a particular program level may still be authorized for a reduced course load due to an illness or medical condition. [35] The student must resume a full course at the start of the next available term or session, excluding a summer session. An F-1 student taking a reduced course load must still be taking at least 6 semester or quarter hours or half the clock hours required for a full course of study. Temporary Illness or Medical Condition A DSO may authorize a reduced course load, or, if necessary, no course load, one or more times for medical reasons, even if the DSO had previously authorized the student to drop below a full course of study for academic difficulties. [36] The period of time cannot exceed an aggregate of 12 months while the student is pursuing a course of study at a particular program level. The student must provide documentation of the illness or medical condition from a licensed medical doctor, psychiatrist, doctor of osteopathy, licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist. Completion of Course of Study A DSO may authorize a reduced course load when a student needs fewer courses than a full course load in the student’s last term to complete the program of study. [37] 2. M-1 Students To maintain status while pursuing a reduced course load, an M-1 student must first obtain their DSO’s authorization. [38] A DSO may authorize an M-1 student for a reduced course load only if the student provides documentation of an illness or medical condition from a licensed medical doctor, psychiatrist, doctor of osteopathy, licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist. A DSO may authorize a reduced course load more than once, but the total period of reduced course load cannot exceed an aggregate of 5 months per course of study. 3. Border Commuter Student A DSO may authorize a border commuter student to enroll in a reduced course load for the above listed reasons, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student’s certified course of study.

Adult education program is defined as a service or instruction below the post-secondary level for individuals who have attained 16 years of age; who are not enrolled or required to be enrolled in secondary school under state law; who lack sufficient mastery of basic educational skills to enable the individuals to function effectively in society; do not have a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent and have not achieved an equivalent level of education; or are unable to speak, read, or write the English language. [^ 11] See Accreditation of English Language Training Programs Act, Pub. L. 111-306 (PDF) (December 14, 2010). The Act amended INA 101(a)(15)(F)(i) to state that F-1 nonimmigrant students intending to pursue an English language training course of study must enroll in an English language training program that has been accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education.

The concurrent enrollment provision is applicable to those students who will be registered less than full-time at the school that issued their Form I-20 , and who are relying on enrollment at another school to meet the requirement that they be enrolled for a full course of study. As long as a student is enrolled full-time at the institution that issued the student’s Form I-20, the student does not need special permission to take an additional class at another school. [^ 17] See 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(iv) . The DSO from the school where the F-1 student will earn the student’s degree is responsible for the reporting requirements to DHS. In instances where a student is enrolled in programs with different full course of study requirements (for example, clock hours vs. credit hours), the DSO is permitted to determine what constitutes a full course of study.

A citizen of a foreign country who seeks to travel to the United States generally must first obtain a U.S. visa.

Certain international travelers may be eligible to travel to the United States without a visa if they meet the requirements for visa-free travel. The visa section of this website contains information on U.S. visas for foreign citizens seeking to travel to the United States. (Note: U.S. citizens don’t need a U.S. visa for travel, but when planning travel abroad may need a visa issued by the country they wish to visit. When planning travel abroad, learn about visa requirements by country, on the country information page of the International Travel Section of this website).

After relevant information is reviewed, the application is approved or denied, based on standards established in U.S. law. While the vast majority of visa applications are approved, U.S. law sets out many standards under which a visa application may be denied. An application may be denied because the consular officer does not have all of the information required to determine if the applicant is eligible to receive a visa, because the applicant does not qualify for the visa category for which he or she applied, or because the information reviewed indicates the applicant falls within the scope of one of the inadmissibility or ineligibility grounds of the law. An applicant’s current and/or past actions, such as drug or criminal activities, as examples, may make the applicant ineligible for a visa. If denied a visa, in most cases the applicant is notified of the section of law which applies. Visa applicants are also advised by the consular officer if they may apply for a waiver of their ineligibility. Several of the most common reasons for visa ineligibilities are explained below. For more information, review the visa ineligibilities in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). How does a visa applicant qualify for a visa? You, as a visa applicant, qualify for a visa by being eligible under all applicable U.S. laws for the visa category for which you are applying. During your visa interview, the consular officer at the U.S Embassy or Consulate will determine if you are qualified for the type of visa for which you are applying. The sole authority to approve or deny (called adjudicate) visa applications, under U.S. immigration law section 104(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act , is given to consular officers at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. What does being found ineligible mean? If a consular officer finds you are not eligible to receive a visa under U.S. law, your visa application will be denied (refused), and you will be provided a reason for the denial. There are many reasons a visa applicant could be found ineligible for a visa. These reasons, called ineligibilities, are listed in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and other immigration laws. Some ineligibilities can be overcome, either by you, the visa applicant, or the U.S. petitioner, in certain immigrant visa cases. Other ineligibilities are permanent. This means that every time you apply for a visa, you will be found ineligible under the same section of law, unless a waiver of that ineligibility is authorized by the Department of Homeland Security. Learn about waivers of ineligibility Here are some examples of visa ineligibilities, with INA references, which are explained further below. The visa applicant: Did not fully complete the visa application and/or provide all required supporting documentation - INA section 221(g) Did not establish eligibility for the visa category being applied for or overcome the presumption of being an intending immigrant - INA section 214(b) Was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude - INA section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) Was convicted of a drug violation - INA section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) Has two or more criminal convictions for which the total sentence of confinement was 5 years or more - INA section 212(a)(2)(B) Did not provide an adequate affidavit of support when one was required; therefore denied under public charge - INA section 212(a)(4) Misrepresented a material fact or committed fraud to attempt to receive a visa – INA section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) Previously remained longer than authorized in the United States - INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) For a complete list of all visa ineligibilities contained in the Immigration and Nationality Act, see Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws I was found ineligible for a visa. Can I get my money back? No. The fee that you paid is a non-refundable application processing fee. Can I reapply for a visa? After being found ineligible for a visa, you may reapply in the future. If you reapply for a visa after being found ineligible, with the exception of 221(g) refusals, you must submit a new visa application and pay the visa application", "metadata": {"id": "4f4f0b2e71c3309d", "url": "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-denials.html", "title": "Visa Denials", "agency": "STATE", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "4f4f0b2e71c3309d-1"}}

If you reapply for a visa after being found ineligible, with the exception of 221(g) refusals, you must submit a new visa application and pay the visa application fee again. If you were found ineligible under section 214(b) of the INA, you should be able to present evidence of significant changes in circumstances since your last application. See more information below under INA section 214(b) Can a friend or relative inquire about my denied visa application? Department of State visa case records are confidential under INA section 222(f), so information can only be provided to visa applicants, with some exceptions. Certain information can be provided to U.S. sponsors, attorneys representing visa applicants, members of Congress, or other persons acting on behalf of and with the permission of applicants. INA Section 221(g) - Incomplete Application or Supporting Documentation What does a visa denial under INA section 221(g) mean? A visa denial under section 221(g) of the INA means that the consular officer did not have all of the information required to conclude you are eligible to receive a visa. This means you are not eligible for the visa now, for one of two reasons: Your application is incomplete and/or further documentation is required - Applicants whose application forms or other documentation are incomplete are refused. If further documents are required to complete your case, you will be informed what is needed and how to provide it to the embassy or consulate. You will also be given a letter stating your application has been denied under 221(g) and listing which documents you need to provide. Administrative processing - The consular officer could not conclude you were elegible for the visa sought and additional administrative processing of your application is required. You will be given a letter stating this; the embassy or consulate will contact you when the administrative processing is complete. Is there something I can do about a refusal under section 221(g)? If your application was denied because documentation or information is missing, you can provide the missing documents or information as soon as possible. After submitting the documentation, your visa application can then be re-assessed to determine whether you qualify for a visa. You have one year from the date you were refused a visa to submit the additional information. Otherwise, if you do not provide the required additional information within one year, you must reapply for the visa and pay another application fee. If your application requires further administrative processing, this takes additional time after your interview. Processing times can vary based on individual circumstances. For more information, review Administrative Processing INA Section 214(b) - Visa Qualifications and Immigrant Intent What does a visa denial under INA section 214(b) mean? This law applies only to nonimmigrant visa categories. If you are refused a visa under section 214(b) , it means that you: Did not sufficiently demonstrate to the consular officer that you qualify for the nonimmigrant visa category you applied for; and/or Did not overcome the presumption of immigrant intent, required by law, by sufficiently demonstrating that you have strong ties to your home country that will compel you to leave the United States at the end of your temporary stay. (H-1B and L visa applicants, along with their spouse and any minor children, are excluded from this requirement.) What are considered strong ties to my home country? Ties are the various aspects of your life that bind you to your home country. Strong ties vary from country to country, city to city, and person to person, but examples include: Your job; Your home; and/or Your relationships with family and friends. While conducting visa interviews, consular officers look at each application individually and consider the applicant's circumstances, travel plans, financial resources, and ties outside of the United States that will ensure the applicant’s departure after a temporary visit. Is a refusal under section 214(b) permanent? No. A refusal, or ineligibility, under section 214(b) is for that specific application, so once a case is closed, the consular section cannot take any further action. There is no appeal process. If you feel there is additional information that should be considered related to the visa decision, or there are significant changes in your circumstances since your last application, you may", "metadata": {"id": "4f4f0b2e71c3309d", "url": "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-denials.html", "title": "Visa Denials", "agency": "STATE", "last_seen": "2025-12-13", "source_type": "html_browser_clean", "chunk_id": "4f4f0b2e71c3309d-2"}}

To reapply, you must complete a new application form, pay the application fee, and schedule an appointment for a new interview. Review the website of the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you plan to reapply to learn about any reapplication procedures. INA Section 212(a)(4) - Public Charge Why was I refused under INA section 212(a)(4)? What is meant by “public charge”? A visa refusal, or ineligibility, under section 212(a)(4) of the INA means that the consular officer determined that you are likely to become a public charge in the United States. Is a refusal under section 212(a)(4) permanent? A refusal, or ineligibility, under section 212(a)(4) can be overcome in certain circumstances, as explained below. Immigrants - Most immigrant visa applicants are required to submit an Affidavit of Support from the U.S. sponsors who filed petitions for them. If your U.S. sponsor does not meet the requirements of the Affidavit of Support, you may present a second Affidavit of Support from a qualifying joint sponsor. Learn more about the Affidavit of Support Some categories of immigrant visa applicants are not required to have Affidavits of Support. These are categories where no U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative filed a petition on your behalf, including most employment-based immigrants and diversity visa (DV) applicants. If you are applying for an immigrant visa category where the Affidavit of Support Form is not required, the following are examples of how you could demonstrate to the consular officer that you will have financial support in the United States: Your own personal funds; A job offer in the United States; and/or Sponsorship from a U.S. resident. Examples of sponsorship from a U.S. resident include: A letter from the U.S. resident stating financial support of you while in the United States; Documents showing that the U.S. resident can financially support you, such as tax transcripts, bank statements or pay stubs; and/or An Affidavit of Support (Form I-134). The consular officer will review the additional evidence of financial support you submit to determine whether it is sufficient to overcome your ineligibility under section 212(a)(4). Nonimmigrants - You must demonstrate sufficient financial support during your temporary stay in the United States. Public charge denials are less frequent for nonimmigrant visa applications, but can occur, for example, in the case of a visa applicant seeking medical treatment in the United States without adequate funds to pay for treatment. Learn more about applying for a visitor visa for medical treatment In order to overcome a denial for public charge reasons, you must demonstrate you will have sufficient financial support in the United States. The consular officer will review the additional evidence you submit to determine whether it is sufficient to overcome your ineligibility under section 212(a)(4). INA Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) - Fraud and Misrepresentation What does a denial under INA section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) mean? You were refused, or found ineligible, for a visa under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) because you attempted to receive a visa or enter the United States by willfully misrepresenting a material fact or committing fraud. This is a permanent ineligibility, so every time you apply for a visa, you will be found ineligible for this reason. You will be advised by the consular officer if you can apply for a waiver of this ineligibility. Review Waivers of Ineligibility for more information. What is meant by misrepresentation of a material fact? Misrepresentation means that you falsely presented facts and were not truthful in an attempt to receive a visa or enter the United States. A fact is considered material, as it pertains to this section of the INA, when, had the truth been known, you would not have been eligible to receive a visa or enter the United States. INA Section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) - Unlawful Presence in the United States What does a denial under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) mean?

INA Section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) - Unlawful Presence in the United States What does a denial under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) mean? You were refused, or found ineligible for, a visa under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) because you were considered to have been unlawfully present in the United States, if: You stayed in the United States after the expiration date for the period of stay authorized by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for you, without the required authorization to extend your stay; or You entered and were present in the United States without receiving the required authorization from CBP. When denied a visa for unlawful presence, you are ineligible for a visa for the following length of time: When unlawfully present in the United States for 180 days or longer but less than one year, you are ineligible for a visa for 3 years after departure from the United States; or When unlawfully present in the United States for one year or longer, you are ineligible for a visa for 10 years after departure from the United States. You will be advised by the consular officer if you can apply for a waiver of this ineligibility. Review Waivers of Ineligibility for more information. List of Ineligibilities This webpage discusses some of the more common visa ineligibilities. For a complete list of visa ineligibilities and more information from the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and amended laws, review Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws on this site. Waivers of Ineligibility What is a waiver? The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) contains provisions that may allow a visa applicant who was denied a visa for a particular ineligibility to apply for a waiver of that ineligibility. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) adjudicates all waivers of ineligibility. Waivers are discretionary, meaning that there are no guarantees that DHS will approve a waiver for you. If the waiver is approved, you may be issued a visa. Can every applicant who is ineligible apply for a waiver? No. If you are found ineligible for a visa, the consular officer will inform you if can apply for a waiver of ineligibility. The following factors will determine if you may apply for a waiver: Whether a waiver of ineligibility is available for the particular section of law you are ineligible under; You must be fully qualified for the visa you applied for, except for that specific ineligibility, in order to be able to apply for the waiver; If you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa, generally whether the consular officer who found you ineligible recommends to DHS that you receive a waiver; and If you are applying for an immigrant visa, whether a waiver is available for your particular situation. (For example, for certain visa ineligibilities when applying for an immigrant visa, you can only apply for a waiver if you have a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse or parent who would endure extreme hardship if you were not able to immigrate.) How do I apply for a waiver? If you can apply for a waiver, the consular officer at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you applied will inform you how to apply. Immigrant Visa and K Nonimmigrant Visa Applicants - If you can apply for a waiver, you must mail Form I-601 , Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, directly to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Lockbox facility, with few exceptions. Learn more on the USCIS website. Further Questions I was found ineligible for a visa, and I have further questions. Who should I contact? You should contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you applied. More Information A-Z Index Latest News Diversity Visa Program What is a U.S. Visa?

If you plan to apply for a nonimmigrant visa to come to the United States as a temporary visitor, please review the current wait time for an interview using the Global Visa Wait Times table linked below. Global Visa Wait Times Wait Time for Interview The estimated wait time to receive a nonimmigrant visa interview appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate and is based on workload and staffing and can vary from week to week. The information provided is an estimate and does not guarantee the availability of an appointment. Wait Time for Interview Waiver Wait times for applicants eligible for Interview Waiver are applicable only for locations where applicants schedule appointments to submit their passport and any required documents to a U.S. embassy or consulate. The wait time estimate does not account for the time required for a consular officer to adjudicate the application nor mailing time of passports or other documents. Refer to the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will apply to determine your eligibility for Interview Waiver and for instructions for submitting a nonimmigrant visa application. Note that applicants must be a national or resident of the country where they are applying to be eligible to apply via Interview Waiver. Qualifications for an Expedited Interview Appointment Consular sections overseas may be able to expedite your interview date if there is an urgent, unforeseen situation such as a funeral, medical emergency, or school start date. The process to request an expedited nonimmigrant visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment. In all cases : You must first submit the online visa application form (DS-160), pay the application fee, and schedule the first available interview appointment. Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment. Note: Travel for the purpose of attending weddings and graduation ceremonies, assisting pregnant relatives, participating in an annual business/academic/professional conference, or enjoying last-minute tourism does not qualify for expedited appointments. For such travel, please schedule a regular visa appointment well in advance. Administrative Processing These estimates do not include time required for administrative processing, which may affect some applications. When administrative processing is required, the timing will vary based on individual circumstances of each case. Administrative Processing Information There are only two possible outcomes for U.S. visa applications. The consular officer will either issue or refuse the visa. If a visa applicant has not established that he or she is eligible for a visa, the consular officer must refuse that application. However, some refused visa applications may require further administrative processing. When administrative processing is required, the consular officer will inform the applicant at the end of the interview. The duration of the administrative processing will vary based on the individual circumstances of each case. At the conclusion of the administrative processing period, the consular officer might conclude that an applicant is now qualified for the visa for which he or she applied. The officer may also conclude that the applicant remains ineligible for a visa. Visa applicants are reminded to apply early for their visas, well in advance of the anticipated travel date. Important Notice: Except in cases of emergency travel (i.e. serious illnesses, injuries, or deaths in your immediate family), before making inquiries about status of administrative processing, applicants should wait at least 180 days from the date of interview or submission of supplemental documents, whichever is later. About Visa Processing Wait Times – Nonimmigrant Visa Applicants Information about nonimmigrant visa wait times for interviews and visa processing time frames are shown on this website, as well as on U.S. Embassy and Consulate websites worldwide.

About Wait Times * Calendar days refers to every day of the week, including days when embassies are closed (such as weekends and holidays). * Wait times are generally the MAXIMUM amount of time you will have to wait to get an appointment. Appointments are continuously being added and you will likely be given an opportunity to move your appointment up as new appointments are opened. † Work days refers only to days when the embassy is open and does not include weekends and holidays. ‡ A, G, and NATO applications are excluded from these wait times, as they are processed separately.

Photos must not be digitally enhanced or altered to change your appearance in any way. Please review the following technical requirements and references for guidance on taking your own photo. Photo Composition Template Digital Image Requirements Use the Department of State’s free photo tool to: select a digital image stored on your computer resize and rotate it if necessary crop it to a square image of exactly 600 x 600 pixels, and save it to your computer for printing Please note: This tool is intended for photo cropping only. A Department of State employee will make the final decision whether your visa photo is acceptable or not for your application. Taking photos of your baby or toddler When taking a photo of your baby or toddler, no other person should be in the photo, and your child should be looking at the camera with his or her eyes open. Tip 1: Lay your baby on his or her back on a plain white or off-white sheet. This will ensure your baby's head is supported and provide a plain background for the photo. Make certain there are no shadows on your baby's face, especially if you take a picture from above with the baby lying down. Tip 2: Cover a car seat with a plain white or off-white sheet and take a picture of your child in the car seat. This will also ensure your baby’s head is supported Change of Appearance If your photo(s) or digital image does not reflect your current appearance, even if it is not older than 6 months, the U.S. embassy or consulate will request that you provide a new photo with your application. Applicants will be requested to obtain a new photo if they have: Undergone significant facial surgery or trauma Added or removed numerous/large facial piercings or tattoos Undergone a significant amount of weight loss or gain Generally, if you can still be identified from the photo in your visa application, you will not need to submit a new photo. For example, growing a beard or coloring your hair would not generally be considered a significant change of appearance. If the appearance of your child under the age of 16 has changed due to the normal aging process, he or she will generally not have to provide a new photo. However, the acceptance of your photo or digital image is at the discretion of the U.S. embassy or consulate where you apply. Español Already have a photo? Use our Photo Tool to crop your photo so it's the right size. This photo tool does not check the quality of your image. This tool is for cropping your photo only when you are applying or renewing using a paper form. Do not use this tool if you are renewing online. After you apply, a U.S. Department of State employee will review your photo and decide if we can accept your photo.

Visitor visas are nonimmigrant visas for persons who want to enter the United States temporarily for business (B-1 visa), for tourism (B-2 visa), or for a combination of both purposes (B-1/B-2 visa). Here are some examples of activities permitted with a visitor visa: Business (B-1) Consult with business associates Attend a scientific, educational, professional, or business convention or conference Settle an estate Negotiate a contract Tourism (B-2) Tourism Vacation (holiday) Visit with friends or relatives Medical treatment Participation in social events hosted by fraternal, social, or service organizations Participation by amateurs in musical, sports, or similar events or contests, if not being paid for participating Enrollment in a short recreational course of study, not for credit toward a degree (for example, a two-day cooking class while on vacation) Travel Purposes Not Permitted On Visitor Visas These are some examples of activities that require different categories of visas and cannot be done while on a visitor visa: Study Employment Paid performances, or any professional performance before a paying audience Arrival as a crewmember on a ship or aircraft Work as foreign press, in radio, film, print journalism, or other information media Permanent residence in the United States Birth tourism (travel for the primary purpose of giving birth in the United States to obtain U.S. citizenship for their child) is not permissible on a visitor visa. How to Apply There are several steps to apply for a visa. The order of these steps and how you complete them may vary by U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Please consult the instructions on the U.S. Embassy or Consulate website Complete the Online Visa Application Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application, Form DS-160 Learn more about completing the DS-160 . You must: 1) complete the online visa application and 2) print the application form confirmation page to bring to your interview. Photo – You will upload your photo while completing the online Form DS-160. Your photo must meet the Photograph Requirements Schedule an Interview Interviews are generally required for visa applicants with certain limited exceptions. Consular officers may require an interview of any visa applicant. You should generally schedule an appointment for your visa interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the country where you live.

L Visa Applicants included in an L blanket petition, must bring Form I-129S to the interview. Legal Rights and Protections H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B visa applicants should read the Legal Rights and Protections pamphlet before applying for a visa. The pamphlet includes information on your rights in the United States and protection available to you. Additional Documentation May Be Required Review the instructions on how to apply for a visa on the website of the embassy or consulate where you will apply. Additional documents may be requested to establish if you are qualified. Most visa applicants, except H-1B and L, need to show their intent to return to their home country after their temporary stay in the United States. They can do so by showing proof of compelling ties to the home country, which may include: A residence abroad which you do not intend to abandon Your family relationships Your economic situation Your long term plans Attend your Visa Interview During the visa interview, a consular officer will determine if you are eligible for the visa. The consular officer will also determine if the visa category is appropriate for your purpose of travel. You will need to establish that you meet the requirements under U.S. law to receive the category of visa for which you are applying. Ink-free, digital fingerprint scans will be taken as part of your application process. They are usually taken during your interview, but this varies based on location. After your visa interview, your application may need further administrative processing . A consular officer will inform you if further processing is necessary for your application. Depending on your nationality, you may need to pay a visa issuance fee. You must pay this fee when the visa is approved. The embassy will explain how your passport with visa will be returned to you. Review the visa processing time , to learn how soon your passport with visa will generally be ready for pick-up or delivery by the courier. Entering the United States A visa allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport). A visa also allows you to request permission to enter the United States. A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States. When admitted, you may get an admission stamp or Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record. Review the CBP website to learn more about entry requirements and customs restrictions. Extending Your Stay You must leave the United States on or before the date indicated on your admission stamp or Form I-94. You can request to extend your stay by contacting USCIS. Visit USCIS's Extend Your Stay website for more information. Failure to leave the United States on time will result in you being out of status . Under U.S. law, visas of travelers who are out of status are automatically voided ( Section 222(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ). If you had a multiple-entry visa and it was voided due to you being out of status, it will not be valid for future entries into the United States. Failure to leave the United States on time may also result in you being ineligible for visas you may apply for in the future. Review Visa Denials and Ineligibilities and Waivers: Laws to learn more. Change of Status While in the United States, you may be able to request a change to another nonimmigrant category. See Change My Nonimmigrant Status on the USCIS website to learn more. Requesting a change of status does not require that you apply for a new visa, as long as you remain in status. If you cannot remain in status while USCIS processes your change of status request, you must apply for a visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. Additional Information The approval of a petition does not guarantee that you will get a visa. Do not make final travel plans or buy tickets until you have a visa.

You may use your valid visa in your expired passport along with a new valid passport for travel and admission to the United States. Visa Denial and Ineligibility Review Visa Denials for detailed information about visa ineligibilities, denials and waivers. Visa Renewal The same visa application process applies for first-time applicants and renewals. Please review How to Apply for more information. Some applicants may be eligible for interview waiver. Interview waiver allows eligible individuals to renew their visa without an in-person interview. To determine if you are eligible for interview waiver, please review the instructions on the website of the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you will apply. I was refused a visa under section 214(b). May I reapply? Yes, if you feel circumstances have changed regarding your application. Review Visa Denials to learn more.

After you receive an interview Appointment Letter from NVC, you must take the following steps BEFORE the interview date. 1. Schedule and Complete a Medical Examination You (and each family member or “derivative applicant” applying for a visa with you) are required to schedule a medical appointment with an authorized physician in the country where you will be interviewed. This exam must be with an embassy-approved doctor, also referred to as the Panel Physician. Exams conducted by other physicians will not be accepted. The exam results can take up to 96 hours. You must complete your medical examination, along with any required vaccinations, before your scheduled visa interview date. Please visit our List of U.S. Embassies and Consulates for country-specific medical examination instructions. After your exam, the Panel Physician will either send the exam results directly to the embassy or give you a sealed envelope. If the doctor gives you an envelope, do not open it. Instead, bring it to your visa interview and give it to the consular officer. Register for Courier Service/Other Pre-Interview Instructions 3. Gather Documents Required for the Interview Every visa applicant, no matter their age, must bring certain documents to the interview, including photographs, and the original or certified copy version of all civil documents submitted to NVC. You do not need to bring your Affidavit of Support or financial evidence you submitted to NVC. Please Note: You should review the validity of all required police certificates you submitted to NVC. Applicants must get a new police certificate if: They turned 16 years old since their case became documentarily complete or They previously submitted a police certificate, but it has expired or will expire before their interview appointment. Police certificates are valid for two years from the date of issuance. Please do not submit your new or updated police certificates to NVC. You must bring original police certificates to your interview appointment. What happens if you forget to bring something on this list? The consular officer will not be able to complete the processing of your visa. You will have to gather the missing items and provide them to the embassy or consulate, and may have to come for additional interviews. Failure to bring all items on the above list can delay visa issuance. PREVIOUS STEP: SUBMIT DOCUMENTS NEXT STEP: APPLICANT INTERVIEW Español VIDEO: Preparing for Your Immigrant Visa Interview FAQs: Interview FAQs: Medical Exam Country Specific Interview Information For detailed information about your visa interview, please visit the U.S. Embassy or Consulate interview preparation instructions of the city where you are having the interview. Who's Involved Applicant : A foreign citizen who is applying for a nonimmigrant or immigrant U.S. visa. The visa applicant may also be referred as a beneficiary for petition based visas.

Nonimmigrant visa applicants from certain countries*/areas of authority may be required to pay a visa issuance fee after their application is approved. These fees are based on the principle of reciprocity: when a foreign government imposes fees on U.S. citizens for certain types of visas, the United States will impose a reciprocal fee on citizens of that country*/area of authority for similar types of visas. How Do I Find Out if I Have to Pay a Reciprocity Fee? Visa Classification: The type of nonimmigrant visa you are applying for. Fee: The reciprocity fee, also known as the visa issuance fee, you must pay. This fee is in addition to the nonimmigrant visa application fee (MRV fee). Number of Entries: The number of times you may seek entry into the United States with that visa. “M” means multiple times. If there is a number, such as “One”, you may apply for entry one time with that visa. Validity Period: This generally means the visa is valid, or can be used, from the date it is issued until the date it expires, for travel with that visa. If your Validity Period is 60 months, your visa will be valid for 60 months from the date it is issued. What is the Difference between the Reciprocity Fee and the Nonimmigrant Visa Application Fee? The nonimmigrant visa application fee, also known as the MRV fee, is a nonrefundable fee paid by most applicants for U.S. visas, whether the application is approved or refused. It covers the costs associated with processing a U.S. visa application. Current nonimmigrant visa application fees can be found on our Fees – Visa Services webpage. (This webpage also lists the few visa categories for which application fees are not required.) While most visa applicants are required to pay the visa application fee, the Reciprocity Fee is only charged to an approved nonimmigrant visa applicant after the visa interview.

(Image only) * With respect to all references to “country” or “countries” on this page, it should be noted that the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-8, Section 4(b)(1), provides that “[w]whenever the laws of the United States refer or relate to foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities, such terms shall include and such laws shall apply with respect to Taiwan.” 22 U.S.C. § 3303(b) (1). Accordingly, all references to “country” or “countries” in the Visa Waiver Program authorizing legislation, Section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1187, are read to include Taiwan. This is consistent with the United States’ one-China policy, under which the United States has maintained unofficial relations with Taiwan since 1979.

Transit (C) visas are nonimmigrant visas for persons traveling in immediate and continuous transit through the United States enroute to another country, with few exceptions. Immediate and continuous transit is defined as a reasonably expeditious departure of the traveler in the normal course of travel as the elements permit and assumes a prearranged itinerary without any unreasonable layover privileges. If the traveler seeks layover privileges for purposes other than for transit through the United States, such as to visit friends or engage in sightseeing, the traveler will have to qualify for the type of visa required for that purpose. If you already have a valid visitor (B) visa , you may be able to use it to transit the United States. If you are a citizen of a participating country, you may be able to transit the United States on the Visa Waiver Program Travel purposes which require a Transit (C) Visa - Examples: A foreign citizen traveling to another country who will have a brief layover in the United States when the only reason for entering the United States is to transit. A passenger embarking from a foreign port on a cruise ship or other vessel which is proceeding to another country, other than the United States, but during the course of the journey, the vessel makes port in the United States with no intention of landing in the United States. A crewmember traveling to the United States as a passenger to join a ship or aircraft you will work on, providing services for operation. You will also need a crewmember D visa, most often issued as a combination C-1/D visa. Learn more about Crewmember visas A crewmember transiting the United States to join a vessel engaged in foreign trade and undertaking lightering activities (defined as the ship-to-ship transfer of liquid cargo) for a period not to exceed 180 days. You will also need a crewmember D-3 visa, most often issued as a combination C-4/D-3 visa. A foreign citizen proceeding in immediate and continuous transit through the United States to or from the United Nations Headquarters District, under provisions of the Headquarters agreement with the United Nations, requires a diplomatic transit (C-2) visa. Travel within the United States will be limited to the immediate New York City vicinity. Travel purposes not permitted on a Transit (C) Visa - Examples: A foreign citizen whose layover in the United States is for a primary purpose other than to transit, for example to visit friends or sightsee, requires a visitor (B) visa A coasting officer seeking to enter the United States generally requires a visitor (B) visa . Coasting officers are employed temporarily when an officer of a foreign ship is granted home leave while the vessel is in U.S. ports, provided the vessel does not remain in U.S. waters for more than 29 days. The coasting officer may then repeat the process with another vessel of the same foreign line.
